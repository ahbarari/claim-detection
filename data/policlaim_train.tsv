Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Governor Baxley, Senator Barron, Representative Newton, members of the Legislature, distinguished guests.	1
I am honored to be in this chamber tonight -- addressing my fellow citizens who are using their lives, their energies and their talents to serve the people of this great state.	0
However, before I address the state of our state, I want to take a moment and recognize some true Alabama heroes.	1
As you may know, our state is in the process of deploying almost 5,000 National Guard troops to various points around the world as our country continues its war on terrorism.	1
These Alabama troops are husbands and wives, sons and daughters, neighbors and friends -- all willing to do their duty and defend the freedoms that we, as Americans, hold so dear.	0
We keep each of these troops in our hearts and in our prayers, and we are so grateful for the sacrifices being made by the families they are leaving behind.	0
Tonight members of my cabinet are wearing yellow ribbons in their honor and Adjutant General Mark Bowen is in attendance with members of his staff.	1
I ask each of you to join me now in paying tribute to the bravery, courage and commitment of the men and women of the Alabama National Guard.	1
As we begin this important legislative session, I remain steadfast in my belief that the people of Alabama are strong in spirit, filled with hope and ready to conquer the obstacles that have held us back for decades.	1
I sense among the members of this Legislature, whether they are Democrat or Republican, that same spirit, hope and desire for change is in each of us.	0
To those of you in this chamber who have pledged to reach across party lines and work together for the good of our state I thank you, and the people of Alabama thank you.	0
Tonight I am charged with speaking to you on the state of our state.	1
Although our state is full of promise, our government faces a fiscal crisis of historic proportions.	1
The best estimates of the Finance Department show that the deficit in the 2004 budget will be at least $500 million.	1
And this is without making any improvements to our schools, correction facilities, or any other state programs that are in dire need of more funding.	1
My fellow Alabamians for the past few years, state government has lived beyond its means.	0
Here is what we have inherited: An Education Trust Fund budget with a deficit of $175 million for this year.	1
In the General Fund one-time revenues of $222 million in the 2003 budget that was used to shore up on-going programs, but which will never be available again Runaway growth in employee benefits which will consume $150 million of the Education Trust Fund budget in 2004.	1
A Medicaid budget which will require a minimum of $70 million to meet mandated benefit growth in 2004.	1
A tremendously under-funded Corrections budget which will need a minimum of $125 million additional dollars in 2004.	1
A doubling of our bonded indebtedness in the last four years.	1
Our government has lived like a family paying the power bill on their credit card every month, just postponing the inevitable.	1
Well, ladies and gentlemen, the inevitable is here.	0
The Alabama Constitution requires that we have a balanced budget; this will require cutting the General Fund Budget by approximately 20 percent, and education expenditures by approximately 6 percent.	1
If we continue the policies of the past, these budget shortfalls will dictate a number of drastic cuts in the upcoming fiscal year.	1
Let me try to put a human face on these numbers: 3,200 teachers and support personnel will be laid off.	1
That is in addition to the 2,000 who will already lose their jobs this spring.	1
Many extra-curricular activities, including high school athletics, will be discontinued.	1
Forty-six troopers will be let go despite the fact that our trooper force is already 25 percent understaffed.	1
Trooper assistance to stranded motorists will be eliminated and nine highway patrol posts will be closed.	1
734 employees in our judicial system will be laid off and jury trials suspended indefinitely.	1
Thousands of child support cases will be affected, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in child support payments.	1
Seven of the 14 inpatient mental health facilities will be closed, while the program that provides medication to the indigent will have to be eliminated.	1
Our lack of matching funds will reduce our Mental Health budget by $38.6 million.	1
450,000 of our citizens will lose access to healthcare because of the lack of funding for our Medicaid programs and 800,000 meals for the elderly will be eliminated.	1
Thousands of our citizens will lose their eligibility for nursing home care, and 60 Senior Service Centers will be closed.	1
If we fail to change the way state government operates, these are the harsh realities our citizens will face.	0
This is the state of our state.	0
The people of Alabama did not create these problems, but they will be the ones who must suffer the consequences.	0
As Governor, I cannot and I will not let that happen!	0
To avoid these Draconian cuts, we are going to change government in Alabama and we are going to change it so fundamentally that we will never face such a crisis again.	1
We are going to demand that years of waste and inefficiencies come to an end, and establish a government that is accountable to the people it serves.	1
We will restore the people''s trust in their state government.	0
This is the mission of my administration.	0
Our first objective is to cut out waste and create efficiencies in government.	1
Let me tell you how we are going to do that.	0
In an effort to lead by example, the Governor''s office is now working with 30 percent less personnel than the previous administration.	1
I have also instructed the head of every state agency to, wherever possible, reduce their personnel costs by 5 percent over the next year.	1
This should save us $75 million annually.	1
We are also in the process of drastically reducing the number of state cars and are looking at going to smaller and less expensive state vehicles.	1
We will cut the aviation staff by 60 percent.	1
We are also halting all out of state travel for any state employee, unless it is of vital interest to the well being of the state.	1
A few weeks ago, I issued an executive order banning all pass through pork from our budget.	1
Ending this process of spending dollars in secret will save tens of millions of dollars and also help restore the public''s faith in the budget process.	1
I have directed Joe McInnes and the Department of Transportation to make their number one priority the resolution of the Reynolds lawsuit that has cost the state of Alabama over $250 million dollars.	1
For that amount of money we could have paved all interstates in Alabama and I-20 twice.	1
And not one dime of this money has gone to the plaintiffs, but rather to the lawyers.	1
This suit continues to cost taxpayers almost half a million dollars a month in legal fees alone.	1
This case must end and it must end now.	0
Every member of my cabinet is looking for ways to save additional taxpayer dollars, through cutting costs and duplication.	1
For example, in the Mental Health Department, Commissioner Sawyer is looking into the consolidation and closure of several mental health facilities.	1
This move alone will net $10 million dollars in state funds and $18 million in federal funds.	1
I''ve instructed my Revenue Commissioner, Dwight Carlisle, to add additional auditors to uncover any unpaid taxes from corporations who are not paying the taxes they owe.	1
It''s time we clamp down on them.	0
If there are loopholes, it is time we close them once and for all.	0
We are also working on plans to control the growth of medical costs for state employees and Medicaid.	1
Other states and businesses have recognized that the growth in these costs will overwhelm a state government and have crafted solutions. We must now do the same.	1
These cuts in government spending are the first immediate steps in reforming state government and making it accountable to the people it serves.	1
However, in order to find long--term solutions, we must make fundamental reforms in our government structure -- changes that will allow us financial flexibility, ensure efficiency and accountability and establish a firm foundation upon which this state can thrive.	0
The first reform that must take place is constitutional reform.	0
Soon after taking office, I established the Alabama Citizens'' Constitution Commission.	1
They have been working for over a month now to devise a plan for long-needed reform in several key provisions of the constitution.	1
I believe the most important change they are considering is the reduction of excessive earmarking in our state budget.	1
Today in Alabama, we predetermine where approximately ninety percent of our revenues go---by far the highest in the United States.	1
When compared to earmarking in other states, Alabama is simply out of sync with the rest of the country.	1
The majority of states earmark about 20 percent of their budgets, and only three other states are over 50 percent.	1
This outlandish amount of earmarking handcuffs our state government and continues to prevent us from being competitive.	0
We must have the ability to move money from one department to another, depending upon where need is the greatest.	0
If not, our only ability to solve a crisis, would be to raise taxes. And, that makes no sense.	0
You could not manage a business under those restrictions or even your household budget.	0
Why then do we believe we can manage a multi-billion dollar state budget with such archaic restrictions?	1
Members of the Legislature, it will take courage on your part to resist the pressure from special interests to keep these earmarks in place, but for the good of Alabama, I challenge you to make this change and make it now.	0
And it is time we re-define the mission of our education system.	0
A majority of taxpayer dollars goes toward the education of our children, yet we remain at the bottom of too many national rankings.	1
I see our mission this way: To provide every child in Alabama with a world-class education that is second to none offered by any state.	0
From this point on we must look at every dollar dedicated to education and determine if it will accomplish this goal.	0
We must ensure that tax dollars make it into the classroom and are not absorbed into a bloated bureaucracy.	0
We must ask the tough questions of what is wrong with our system.	0
If it is simply an issue of more money, then we will find the necessary funding.	1
But, before we increase spending, we are going to cut out waste, eliminate duplication and guarantee our dollars are going into the classroom.	1
To that end, we have established the Education Spending Commission to provide the people of Alabama with a clear picture of how all education dollars are being spent.	1
We must also return more control of education to the local school systems and the teachers and principals.	0
School systems that have proven to be good managers of their resources should be given greater flexibility.	1
At the same time, school systems that have wasted the public's money will be strictly controlled and dealt with severely.	1
These changes will result in substantial cost-savings and increased accountability in our education system.	1
Tonight, I have delivered the difficult but honest report that is the state of our state.	1
In speeches past, political rhetoric has clouded and often hidden the truth of our reality.	0
But, you did not elect me to mislead or misinform you.	0
You elected me to be honest and direct with you and to offer solutions to the very real problems we have faced for too long.	0
There are many today that say we must immediately raise taxes in light of the situation we have inherited.	1
That may be forced upon us one day, because I have pledged that no essential state services will be discontinued to those who depend upon them.	1
But, I will not entertain the idea of additional taxes until we reform the policies and practices that have created the problems we face today.	1
Too many small businesses and citizens are burdened by our tax structure and higher taxes should be considered only as a last resort, not the first.	1
As everyone in this chamber knows, the people of Alabama will not support any tax increases until we have restored their trust and returned credibility to state government.	0
While I am hesitant to propose higher taxes, I am dedicated to fairer taxes.	0
In Alabama we start taxing income at $4,600.	1
This is not just wrong -- it is immoral.	0
This forces so many of our working poor and elderly who are living on a fixed income to bear a disproportionate burden.	1
Quite often, this means the most vulnerable among us are having to decide between buying prescription drugs, paying the power bill or putting food on the table.	1
No one can defend such a system.	0
We are working to devise a tax reform policy that will be comprehensive and fair, but we will not allow haste to replace thoughtful deliberation.	1
For years we have tried to reform taxes at the expense of one group over another, and each time this effort has failed.	1
The politics of division can never be the foundation for reform.	0
Despite the many challenges that face us, I am optimistic every day I come to work because we have assembled the most impressive Cabinet in the history of our state.	0
These talented men and women are working day and night to solve the entrenched problems in Montgomery.	0
The good news is there are answers and we are making progress.	0
I know that these trials will not get the better of us---they will simply make us better.	0
I believe in the people of Alabamain their pride, their compassion, their strength and honor.	0
With hard work and perseverance, we will overcome our problems and leave this government better than we found it.	0
My fellow citizens, this is not a fight we will lose.	0
We must build a foundation that will last for generations, and we will construct a government that is accountable to the people it serves and fair to every citizen, regardless of their position in society.	0
In my campaign, I promised every Alabamian that I would work for a new day in Alabama.	1
Tonight I am reiterating that promise with my plan to guide us out of these difficult times and into a new era of Alabama history.	1
But the only way to bring about change is to join together as Alabamians united in a common cause.	0
During this legislative session and throughout the next four years we must work togetherit is what the people demand and what the people deserve.	0
My challenge to you is that a year from now when we gather for this address we will be able to report to the people of Alabama that their elected leaders have honestly confronted the challenges that face them; that they have determined the wise course of action and summoned the collective will to make the courageous choices that will begin a new chapter in our history a chapter that may prove to be our greatest.	0
May God Bless You and the Great State of Alabama.	0
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Senator McKinney, Representative Cafero, ladies and gentlemen of the General Assembly, honored guests, and all the citizens of our great state watching or listening today - thank you for inviting me to address you.	1
As always, let us thank and honor the brave men and women of Connecticut serving in our Armed Forces around the globe.	1
I'd like to recognize my wife Cathy and my son Dannel who are here today.	1
The State of Connecticut could not have a better Lt. Governor, and I could not have a better friend, than Nancy Wyman.	1
Thanks to Nancy's hard work, Connecticut is leading the nation in getting people signed up for affordable care.	1
Introduction I want to begin today with a story that I think says a lot about who we are in Connecticut, and where we're headed.	0
This past December I visited a small business owner named Steve Weinstein.	1
Steve runs a farm in East Hartford that was devastated by the February snowstorm that blanketed our state last year.	1
Much of his property was left unusable.	1
He lost 80 percent of his production capacity.	1
His business was close to failure. Steve had a choice to make. What did he do? He dug in. He pushed ahead.	1
He did the hard-but-necessary work of rebuilding.	1
Today Steve's company is back in business sending locally grown products to towns and cities across Connecticut.	1
He isn't back to 100 percent - rebuilding takes time - but thanks to his hard work and just a little help from the state, he's making real progress, and he's part of Connecticut's economic recovery.	1
That kind of resilience is inspiring.	0
And yet, it's something that I see almost every day in the people of our great state.	0
"Mark Twain called Connecticut ""the land of steady habits,"" and through our long and storied history, many of those habits have driven us to accomplish great things."	1
Our courage helped found this country, and our ingenuity helped spur the industrial revolution.	0
In recent years our habits have carried us through some difficult times, as well: through the great recession, through storms that battered our homes and our businesses, and even through our darkest day just over one year ago.	1
Time and again, Connecticut has demonstrated a resolve and a devotion that has carried us forward.	0
Unfortunately, there's another side to our steady habits - one that hasn't served us quite so well.	0
Over time, certain bad habits have kept Connecticut's government from keeping up with a changing world.	0
Putting off hard decisions left our state with a deficit that was among the worst in the nation just three years ago.	1
Bouncing from one economic development strategy to the next sent mixed messages to employers.	1
And a tendency to shy away from big changes kept Connecticut from making desperately-needed investments in our energy infrastructure, our affordable housing stock, and our schools and colleges.	1
I say this not to lay blame for past problems, but because those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it.	0
I say it so that we can understand what we've changed, and precisely what that change has meant to the people of Connecticut: More than 40,000 new private sector jobs grown over the past three years, spread throughout every region of Connecticut; An unemployment rate that has gone from a high of 9.4 percent in 2010, down to 7.4 percent today; Home values that are finally on the rise after years of decline; Crime rates that have dropped to a 46-year low; A plan in place that will bring cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable energy to Connecticut; A state that now ranks nationally as top five in energy efficiency, top four in worker productivity, top three in the number of advanced degrees, top two in production efficiency, and number one in the health of its citizens. … Our work hasn't been easy.	1
No person - and certainly no government - is perfect. Lord knows I'm not.	0
All of our progress has come with setbacks along the way.	0
But together we've proven that positive change, while hard, is possible. That progress is possible.	0
That's what I want to talk to you about today: How together we're making positive changes, and seeing real progress.	0
How we must ensure that hardworking families share in that progress, and share in Connecticut's recovery.	0
And how, in order to keep this recovery going, we need to continue making thoughtful, even bold investments in our future, and in the future of our children.	0
Responsible Budgeting and Tax Relief Let's talk about how we're achieving some of that positive change.	0
For one, together we're making hard-but-necessary budget decisions.	0
A big part of growing an economy that's built for the long-term is making sure state government is living within its means and controlling its debt.	0
For too long Connecticut ignored that responsibility, racking up deficits and letting our long-term debt grow larger and larger. It all came to a head in 2009.	1
The budget that eventually went into effect borrowed $1 billion for operating expenses, it drained every penny from a $1.4 billion rainy day fund, and it deferred $50 million in required pension payments, part of more than $300 million in payments that would be deferred over the next three fiscal years. Think about that.	1
In one fell swoop, the State of Connecticut undertook the largest deficit financing in its history, used up its entire savings, and refused to pay its pension obligations.	1
Today, after a lot of tough decisions and strong leadership from many people in this chamber, we've come a long way: Together we've turned a $3.6 billion deficit into a $500 million surplus; We've cut our total long-term debt by more than 11 and a half billion dollars, the equivalent of $3,200 for each and every man, woman, and child in Connecticut; And we've already put more than $270 million into our rainy day fund.	1
… We aren't out of the woods yet.	0
We have a lot of work left to do.	0
But together we've taken the more responsible path.	0
The result is this year's $500 million surplus.	1
Last week I announced a simple, three-part approach for the responsible use of those funds.	1
First, the lion's share should go directly into our rainy day fund.	0
My proposal would bring the rainy day fund to more than half a billion dollars this year.	1
Second, we should continue to reduce our long-term debt by making an extra $100 million payment toward state pension obligations.	1
The return on that investment will mean a $430 million reduction in our long-term debt.	1
And third, we should give something back to Connecticut taxpayers, because if the people of Connecticut are going to share in the sacrifice during tough times, they should also share in the recovery as things begin to turn around.	0
Together, we can issue a targeted refund to Connecticut taxpayers to return to them some of the sales and gas taxes they've paid.	1
A refund of $110 for families and $55 for individuals will help offset the payments they've made toward those taxes.	1
Is it going to solve all the problems of any one person in Connecticut? Of course not. But it can certainly help.	0
And by giving money back to people who will spend it on things they need, we're also injecting $155 million directly into our state's economy.	1
Economists at the University of Connecticut predict that this refund could result in 1,200 new jobs in Connecticut this year.	1
Let me be clear: I don't believe in short term fixes, and this should not be a one-time approach.	0
A bill I submit to you today would ensure this framework is required for any future budget surplus.	1
So that whenever Connecticut has the means, we do three things: we shore up our savings, we reduce our debt, and we give back to taxpayers.	1
Finally, let me say this: If our surplus increases in the months ahead, the extra funds should be split between our rainy day fund and long-term obligations - not spent.	0
… That's how I think we should handle this year's surplus.	0
But that's a separate question from how we continue to manage our budget for long-term recovery.	0
The adjustments I submit to you today follow some simple principles we've put in place together.	0
First, we have to live within our means.	0
Let's not spend one penny more than the previously-adopted General Fund budget.	1
Second, we have to keep paying down long-term debt.	1
Let's continue to make responsible debt payments we've already planned, on top of that $100 million additional pension payment.	1
And third, in addition to short-term relief from a tax refund, we should also begin providing longer-term relief, to make sure that taxpayers continue to share in Connecticut's recovery.	0
Here's a few ways we can do it.	0
First, we can continue the planned implementation of a sales tax exemption on clothing items of $50 or more.	1
When fully restored, this will save taxpayers an estimated $140 million per year.	1
Second, we know that over time the cost of medication has grown more and more expensive.	1
To help ease that burden, I propose we once again exempt non-prescription drugs from sales tax.	1
Third, for many years towns in Connecticut have been subject to a tax on their municipal health care plans.	1
We should give them a break by exempting towns from this tax.	0
This will in turn help them hold down local property taxes.	1
And finally, there is a group of retirees in Connecticut that has for too long been subject to a very basic tax unfairness.	1
I'm talking about Connecticut's retired teachers.	0
After decades educating our children, our teachers' pension payments are taxed differently than social security - which teachers can't participate in.	1
Let's treat teachers' pensions more like social security by exempting part of those payments from the state income tax.	1
My proposal would begin with a 25 percent exemption this calendar year as a phase-in to a 50 percent exemption the following year.	1
It's the right thing to do for retired teachers and we should get it done together.	0
… All told, the tax cuts in my proposed budget amount to more than $280 million over the next two years, and more than $440 million when you include the tax refund.	1
This is modest - but real - relief.	0
Relief designed to ease the burden of working families and help them share in Connecticut's recovery, now and into the future.	1
It's my belief that it can and should be a down-payment on larger tax cuts as our economy continues to improve in the years ahead.	0
Whether it's corporate, income, sales, or property tax, every part of Connecticut's tax code should be reviewed, scrutinized, and reduced when-and-where possible as our economy continues to grow.	0
Continuing to Grow Jobs Here's another positive change we're making.	1
After years of complacency, Connecticut is playing an aggressive role partnering with employers to create jobs and grow our economy.	1
Consider this: from 2002 through 2010, our Department of Economic and Community Development partnered with a total of 118 businesses.	1
That's nine years, 118 businesses, and we didn't have any program focused on helping Connecticut's small businesses.	1
In the two years since we came together to pass an historic, bipartisan jobs bill, I'm proud to say that DECD's Small Business Express program has extended a helping hand to nearly one thousand small businesses around our state.	1
All told, this program has helped create and maintain more than 13,800 jobs.	1
That's 13,800 good jobs that exist today because of a program almost every Democrat and Republican in this chamber voted to support.	1
I want to thank you for that, and I know the people in those jobs thank you, as well.	0
We're also focusing on industries that are most likely to grow jobs in the years ahead.	1
So in addition to supporting our flagship insurance and financial services industries, we're focusing on jobs in bioscience, advanced manufacturing, digital media, and green technologies.	1
Here's another positive change we're making: we started the hard task of bringing Connecticut's regulations into the 21st century.	1
Last fall we began an open process of listening directly to businesses, provider partners, and the public so that we could get rid of regulations that are burdensome, or just not relevant.	1
In the coming weeks I will announce the results of this effort, which will do away with nearly one thousand pages of unnecessary state regulations.	1
… Taken together, all of these positive changes have helped create more than 40,000 new private sector jobs and lower Connecticut's unemployment rate by two percentage points in just three short years. That's real progress. It's real change.	1
And if you don't think so, just ask Emily Thomsen.	0
Emily works for Oxford Performance Materials in South Windsor, a biomedical company that makes medical implant devices.	1
A company that, after our jobs session in 2011, received a state loan and grant that helped them purchase new machinery and hire 12 more employees, doubling their workforce.	1
Emily is a UConn graduate who studied biomedical engineering.	1
But a few years after she graduated, she found herself looking for work.	1
Thankfully, after months of searching, she got one of those 12 new jobs at Oxford.	1
"She's been there more than two years now, and she's already been promoted twice. She calls it her ""dream job. Emily is here with us today."	1
I want to congratulate her on her success.	0
Because of the people in this chamber, there are thousands of more stories like Emily's across Connecticut.	0
It's been said that government doesn't create jobs - and that's true.	0
But what government can do is help give a company like Oxford a better chance to grow here in Connecticut , to succeed here in Connecticut .	1
Still, as long as even one person in Connecticut is looking for a job, then we all have more work to do.	0
… Here are three ways we can continue helping employers to grow jobs this session.	1
First, we can continue to fund the Small Business Express program, which has a proven record of success.	1
Second, the budget adjustments I submit to you today include $125 million to support Connecticut businesses.	1
That includes increased funding for the Manufacturing Assistance Act, to help grow some of those target industries I mentioned, as well as a new Advanced Manufacturing Fund.	1
Together these initiatives will provide incentive-driven financial assistance to Connecticut businesses to help them modernize their technologies, focus on research and development, and create the jobs of tomorrow.	1
Third, we need to keep removing barriers to employment and reducing the number of unemployed workers in Connecticut.	0
We can do it by continuing to support our successful STEP UP program with an additional $10 million investment in the coming fiscal year, so we can incentivize employers to hire and train more people.	1
To date, 578 small businesses in Connecticut have participated in STEP UP, helping more than 2,000 unemployed job seekers gain employment.	1
Let's make these important investments together, and let's continue to grow jobs in Connecticut.	0
Supporting Connecticut Workers As we work with Connecticut employers to grow jobs, we also need to keep fighting for the people filling those jobs.	1
There are those who claim that any action taken in support of employees is, by definition, harmful to our economy. I fundamentally disagree.	0
A balanced approach that supports both workers and their employers is not only possible, it's the only responsible path.	0
A great example of that balance is the important work we did two years ago to guarantee paid sick leave for employees.	1
It was the right thing to do, it was done in the right way, and it has benefited the people of our state.	0
Last year, we moved forward once again when we came together to raise Connecticut's minimum wage.	1
Thanks to the great leadership of President Williams and Speaker Sharkey, and many others here today, the approach we took is already making life just a little bit easier for some of our hardest working citizens.	1
One of those hard working citizens is Sue Bryant-Durham, a mother from East Hartford, with four kids at home.	1
Over the years Sue has held a number of different jobs to help provide for her children.	1
She's worked in construction, she's worked in retail, and right now she works in the fast food industry.	1
On January 1, Sue got the first raise she's had at that job.	1
Sue is here with us today and I want to thank her for her hard work.	1
This session, we should continue our progress on the minimum wage.	0
Let's take a clear stand and a clear position of leadership in this national debate.	0
I propose that together, we increase Connecticut's minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents by 2017.	1
It's a target the President has set, and we should lead the way there.	1
We can do it by moving next January's scheduled increase to 45 cents, and then adding 45 cents the following year, and 50 cents the year after that.	1
This is good public policy, it's good economic policy, and it's the right thing to do.	0
Let's increase Connecticut's minimum wage together.	0
… In the same way that we're making investments in the industries most likely to grow jobs, it also makes sense to invest in the people most ready to rejoin our workforce.	1
I can't think of anyone more ready and more deserving of our assistance, than Connecticut's veterans.	0
We know that homelessness and unemployment are intrinsically linked; part of a terrible downward spiral that captures too many people, especially veterans.	1
Right now there are more than 500 homeless veterans in Connecticut. It's unacceptable.	1
Today, the pledge we should take together is simple: Connecticut can and will end homelessness for veterans by the end of 2015.	1
That's a pledge President Obama made for America, and it's a pledge we must embrace.	1
My budget proposal includes funding for a new security deposit assistance program to help veterans get over that first hurdle to finding a home.	1
It funds the hiring of job placement specialists trained in understanding the challenges - and the opportunities - unique to veterans.	1
And it sets aside $500 thousand to support a review of existing state facilities so that we can put them to their best use for Connecticut's Veterans.	1
This is all a big first step toward ensuring that every veteran in Connecticut can get back on their feet, back under a roof, and back to work.	0
Improving Access to Quality Education I've said a number of times today that we need to make sure everyone can share in our recovery.	1
We know the best way to increase someone's chances for success is a quality education.	1
In that spirit, I want to leave you today with five ideas that I think will help give every Connecticut student access to a great education.	1
I want to work with you on these five initiatives because years from now, when the great recession is a distant memory, long-after the political battles of this year have faded, this should be our legacy: that we made sure all Connecticut kids get a great education, one that starts early and takes them as far as their dreams and hard work will allow.	0
… First, and for the first time in our history, let's commit Connecticut to achieving universal pre-kindergarten.	1
We can start with an additional 1,020 early childhood opportunities next year, expanding to 4,000 new opportunities by 2019.	1
We can give grants to communities so they have the tools to implement these changes.	1
And, we can give much-needed rate increases to school readiness providers, child care centers, and Care-For-Kids programs.	1
We know that early education is one of the best ways to level the playing field for students.	1
We know it, because we've seen it firsthand.	0
Tamara Jackson is a Hartford mom with two kids who are currently receiving early learning experiences.	1
Her son Andrew was born two months premature, and she worried about his development.	1
A little over a year ago Andrew moved into a new early education program.	1
Tamara says his progress has been nothing short of remarkable.	1
With the help of some great teachers, he's already caught up to his peers.	1
His experience has put him on equal footing, and given him the tools he needs to learn.	0
I want to welcome Andrew's mom, Tamara who is here with us this afternoon.	1
Let's help more kids like Andrew by moving our state to universal pre-k.	1
It will be a long and thoughtful process, but if you believe as I do that education is the civil rights issue of our time, then I ask you to join me today in taking the first steps toward making sure every child has access to a pre-k experience.	0
This would build on our important work begun last year to create the Office of Early Childhood.	1
We need to finish that work by codifying this Office in statute.	1
I am ready to sign that legislation today.	1
… Here's the second initiative: let's help make college a little more affordable.	1
We can do it with a simple promise to Connecticut parents: beginning this year, for every child born or adopted in Connecticut, the state will help them start a tax-free college savings account and put a $100 investment into it for them.	1
And if parents save another $150 dollars in the first four years, we'll match that for a total state investment of $250 dollars.	1
Is that investment going to pay for a full college education 18 years later? Of course not.	1
But it can give new parents a boost right when they need it most, and it can help encourage college saving right from the start.	1
"I look forward to working with our great treasurer Denise Nappier to create this ""CHET Baby Scholars"" program."	1
Together, let's make an investment in every child that will help them afford college.	0
Of course, this initiative would not help anyone with a child already in school.	1
That's why my budget also increases funding to the Governor's Scholarship Program, bringing it to more than $45 million in total, which will help more students afford college in the years ahead.	1
… Third, let's help give our kids the experience they need to fill the highly-skilled jobs of the future.	1
To ensure that our students are better prepared for college and a career when they finish high school, particularly in high-tech disciplines, we need to consider new models for hands-on learning.	0
This year, my administration will continue to work with teachers, community colleges, and business partners toward the creation of early college initiatives, which would allow students to earn college credit during high school.	1
We can do it by partnering with the IBM Corporation and other local companies to develop a Connecticut version of P-TECH, IBM's acclaimed, innovative high school and college partnership.	1
This approach will allow students to graduate with both a high school diploma and an associate's degree.	1
Let's offer students this experience, and help put them on a path to a great job.	0
… Fourth, let's continue to invest in our state university and college system.	1
"The ""Transform CSCU 2020"" initiative will provide an initial investment of more than $134 million to help bring all 17 campuses into a single, student-centered, technology rich-system."	1
It will help colleges adapt to student needs and offer the kind of dynamic higher education experience that students want and employers expect.	1
Let's help colleges from Norwalk to Naugatuck Valley to Eastern Connecticut State University.	1
Let's move our state university and community college system into the 21st century. Let's do that together.	0
… Fifth, and finally, let's help graduate as many students as possible.	1
When a student fails to graduate from college it's a lost opportunity for the student, the college, and our economy.	0
And right now there are an estimated 113,000 people in Connecticut who fit that description - people who began working towards a degree but for whatever reason didn't graduate. Here's what we can do.	1
If you're a student who began a degree program but have been out of school for more than 18 months, Connecticut will offer one free course for each course you take at a public college - and up to three free courses in total - if you come back and matriculate.	1
"This ""Go Back to Get Ahead"" program will run for a limited amount of time."	1
It's designed to incentivize people to pay off a debt - a debt they owe themselves.	1
Let's help more students graduate, and let's help them share in Connecticut's recovery.	0
… These five proposals - taken together - are part of a continuum, one that would help our kids from birth all the way through college.	1
Let's work to build this future together.	0
A future where every child has access to an early learning experience; A future that gives every kid the opportunity for higher education - one they can afford; A future where we are graduating as many students as possible into good jobs, with good benefits, right here in Connecticut.	0
That's the kind of future Connecticut families deserve.	0
Conclusion I recognize everything I've laid out today is a lot to tackle in a short session.	0
But working together, we can get it done.	0
There's only one thing that can stop us: ourselves.	0
Teddy Roosevelt said a century ago that it's not the critic who counts, but those who strive to do great things. We hear plenty of critics now.	1
Even as sunshine begins to break through the clouds, there are some intent on hoping for thunderstorms.	0
I said earlier that Nancy Wyman has led the implementation of the most successful health exchange in America and helped achieve affordable health care for nearly one hundred thousand people.	1
When our exchange faces some unforeseen hurdle, the critics urge us to throw up our hands and keep more people from getting covered. We should not listen. Connecticut is moving forward.	0
I also spoke about the work we've done to partner with Connecticut small businesses.	1
Will every single one of those investments pay off? Of course not.	1
And if one fails, the critics would say that's reason enough to stop investing in small businesses altogether. We should not listen. Connecticut is moving forward.	0
And now, during this session, those critics will say that for one reason or another that we can't increase the minimum wage, that we can't expand access to early childhood education, that we can't find ways to make college more affordable.	0
They'll say the time isn't right, or that Connecticut just can't afford to do it. I say they're wrong.	0
Connecticut must move forward , because the people of our state have sacrificed, and now they deserve to share in our emerging recovery.	0
We know that none of our progress will come without setbacks; none of it will be perfect in execution.	0
The question before us is how should we define ourselves: by our setbacks, or by our successes?	0
This session, let this be our answer: That together we will have the courage to continue pushing for bold, positive change; The compassion to ensure that everyone can share in Connecticut's recovery; And the faith to believe that Connecticut's best days are still ahead. Thank you.	0
May God bless you, may God bless the United States of America, and may God bless the great State of Connecticut.	0
There are some new faces here in Legislative Hall today as we gather to assess the state of our state.	1
Legislators with names like Mulrooney, Miro, DeLuca, Simpson, Cloutier, Viola, Valihura and Winslow have joined us here for the first time.	1
Why don't we start this afternoon by warmly welcoming each of them and expressing our appreciation for the men and women they succeed?	0
You've joined a body that includes many distinguished legislators -- and one or two real characters.	1
Let me take a few moments to mention the accomplishments of a few of the General Assembly's most distinguished members.	0
We'll save the characters for another day.	0
Joining Lt. Governor Minner and President Pro-Tem Sharp in presiding over this joint session is the person who has been selected by his colleagues as Speaker of the House for more terms than anyone in Delaware history -- Terry Spence.	1
Bob Gilligan, the Democratic leader of the House, has been elected by the people of his district 14 times now -- more than any member of the House in Delaware history.	1
Thurman Adams, dean of the Senate with 26 years of service -- and chair at various times of both the Executive and Agriculture Committees -- this month becomes, at the tender age of 70, the majority leader of the Delaware State Senate.	1
And, Bruce Reynolds, who joined Senator Sokola and others in co-sponsoring landmark education accountability legislation last year, becomes the first coach in Delaware history whose high school football teams have won 200 games.	1
Governors have been delivering an annual state of the state address in Delaware for more than 200 years.	1
Today, I give what some will describe as the last state of the state address of the 20th century.	1
I went back and read the first state of the state address of this century -- given by Governor Ebe Tunnell some 98 years ago.	1
His subjects that day touched on issues which are still important today to Delawareans, including education reform, the preservation of natural resources, and the safety of residents throughout the state.	1
"Governor Tunnell also called for elections to be ""orderly"", but I'm not so sure a Governor has yet been able to accomplish that."	1
Governor Tunnell laid out almost a century ago what he believed Delaware needed to undertake as it began the 20th century.	1
Today, I will speak to those things that Delaware needs to complete as we prepare to step into a new century and a new millennium.	1
My message focuses on finishing what we've begun - providing a foundation so that future generations may enjoy a quality of life as good as, or better than, the one we now enjoy.	0
Where does the end of the 20th century find our state?	0
It finds us with the strongest economy in our region and one of the strongest economies in America.	1
In survey after survey, Delaware wins praise as one of the best states in America to grow a business.	1
In the last year alone, Delaware was #5 in job creation and had the second-fastest growth nationwide in median family income over the past two years.	1
Tomorrow, the Department of Labor will report that our unemployment rate dropped last month to 3.1 percent - the lowest in a decade.	1
Over 62,000 jobs have been created in Delaware since January of 1993 when we took office.	1
Two decades of bipartisan financial stewardship have yielded a string of balanced budgets, a Rainy Day fund that now holds over $114 million, and the highest credit rating in Delaware history. We have no sales tax.	1
Our property taxes are among the lowest in America.	1
With the latest tax cuts that became effective three weeks ago, our state's top marginal personal income tax rate -- not long ago the second highest in America -- has been reduced by more than two-thirds.	1
Most working families still living in poverty pay no state income taxes until their income exceeds 100 percent of poverty.	1
Every business in Delaware paying the gross receipts tax also received a tax cut on January 1, and a third of them now pay no gross receipts tax at all.	1
Taxes aren't the only thing we've cut.	1
Our welfare rolls are down by over 40 percent since 1994.	1
Families are better off working today than remaining on welfare.	1
We've eliminated the waiting list for low-income eligible childcare, and families in Delaware no longer have to choose between going to work and keeping health care coverage.	1
We're waging a war against infant mortality, too -- and we're winning.	1
Delaware's rate, just a few years ago the highest in the nation, has been driven below the national average.	1
Every Delaware public school now has a nurse.	1
Wellness centers operate in most public high schools.	1
Nemours pediatric health clinics dot our landscape.	1
Medicaid managed care has enabled us to extend coverage to 15,000 additional poor working people.	1
Tax credits encourage our smallest employers to provide health care coverage for employees.	1
A recent report from the U. S. Census Bureau shows that while the percentage of uncovered persons nationwide is going up, in Delaware, it's coming down.	1
On January 1, we took another giant step forward: kids without coverage from families earning between 100 and 200 percent of poverty became eligible to participate in a good, comprehensive plan of health care known as the Delaware Healthy Children Program -- for as little as $10 to $25 per month, per family.	1
Universal health care coverage for children in Delaware -- a goal that many of us share -- is finally within our grasp.	1
We have been fighting on another front, as well: to take back our streets.	0
The State Police reported two weeks ago that violent crimes in their jurisdictions across Delaware dropped by 14 percent in 1998.	1
Every single category of violent crime came down.	1
Operation Safe Streets helped drive down shootings in Wilmington by a third over the past 12 months.	1
More than 1,400 probation and parole violators found out that zero tolerance means zero tolerance. We've hired more police.	1
We're training them better than ever, and we are equipping them with the kind of technology that's enabling them to turn the tide against crime.	1
Delaware has launched the largest prison expansion in state history, too, but we're doing more than just adding prison cells.	1
Beginning this year, every inmate serving a year or more in prison must participate in our nationally recognized Key and Crest programs.	1
Participation in both of these programs reduces by 40 percent the likelihood that inmates upon release will reoffend and end up back in prison.	1
Early results from our boot camp show that a tough regimen of exercise, school work, drug and alcohol treatment -- along with intensive community service -- can help young men and women turn their lives around.	1
Prisons aren't the only things we're building either.	1
The year just ending saw more road construction, more maintenance, and repair than in any year in Delaware history.	1
DelDOT completed the dualization of Route 896 to the C&D Canal, the resurfacing of Route 141, the Bridgeville bypass, the Route 273 and Lancaster Pike expansions, and major improvements at the Christina riverfront. All done in 1998.	1
In 1999, another impressive list awaits: the dualization of Naamans Road, a project first envisioned when Governor Tunnell was in office, I think. will be completed.	1
The Scarborough Road extension in Dover will open, as will the next leg of SR 1 between the C&D Canal and south Odessa.	1
And Churchman's Crossing, the busiest intersection in Delaware, will be completed under budget and ahead of schedule.	1
Other transportation improvements include the introduction of E-Z pass on I-95 and early this year on SR1.	1
A new Integrated Traffic Management System is improving traffic on busy thoroughfares from Newark's Main Street to the Kirkwood Highway, and on to Concord Pike in northern Delaware.	1
Soon, it will serve the rest of our state.	1
Public transit has been introduced throughout central and southern Delaware.	1
DART ridership is up 22 percent statewide since 1995.	1
We now run buses at night and on weekends.	1
More people are taking the train, too.	1
With the opening of a new station in Newark, rail ridership grew by nearly 25 percent since 1997.	1
Another new station near Churchman's Crossing opens in just over a year and with it, commuter rail ridership will surge again.	1
Everybody -- even governors -- complains about their states' transportation departments. It's our birthright.	0
But, it's also important to remember that there are many good men and women at DelDOT who are working a lot harder these days to create a transportation system for Delaware that is ready for the 21st Century.	1
They have my thanks, and I hope they have yours, as well.	0
Where we build our roads has a large impact on where people live.	1
We've been working with the Gordon Administration to limit unnecessary sprawl, especially in southern New Castle County.	1
Smart land use policies are an important part of our stewardship of the environment and the preservation of our natural resources.	1
Today, Delaware is the #1 state in America for agland preservation. #1!	1
Working with the General Assembly and environmentalists over the past six years, we have protected forever another 16,000 acres of open space.	1
We're transforming a long-abandoned industrial wasteland along the banks of the Christina River into a recreational area of real beauty for a million visitors each year to enjoy.	1
And, we've assumed management of the Brandywine Park and Zoo along the Brandywine River - with a commitment to making them shine.	1
In the past decade, we've cut industrial and manufacturing emissions of toxic chemicals into our water by nearly 80 percent and into our air by even more than that.	1
We have met the strict requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.	1
We're also implementing a 10-year action plan to dramatically reduce pollution emptying into our inland bays, the Appoquinimink River, and other waterways that have suffered from decades of neglect.	1
And finally, more than 25 years after the General Assembly enacted Governor Russell Peterson's Coastal Zone Act to protect our state's fragile coastline, this month, new regulations to fully implement that law will take effect.	1
Governor Peterson is here with us today.	1
I'd like to ask him to stand and be recognized for the leadership he has provided in preserving our coastline and open space.	1
Governor, thank you for reminding us to remain vigilant in meeting our responsibility to protect our environment for ourselves and for future generations of Delawareans.	0
I'd also like to take this opportunity today to propose naming the urban wildlife refuge under development along the banks of the Christina River in your honor.	1
THE 1999 AGENDA Despite the great progress we're making in Delaware, there is still plenty to do.	0
I pledge to you today that those of us in the Carper-Minner Administration will use every one of the next 726 days to work with this General Assembly to complete what we've begun -- preparing for our future and all the opportunity it holds.	1
This afternoon, I want to begin to outline an ambitious and comprehensive agenda that builds on our successes and addresses the challenges that lie ahead.	0
Let's begin by focusing first on taxes and fiscal responsibility.	0
LOWER TAXES AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY For six years now, we've prudently managed our state's fiscal affairs while providing Delawareans with a wide variety of tax cuts.	1
This year, revenue growth has slowed -- sending us a warning signal to proceed with caution in enacting further tax reductions.	1
As you know, left on the table from last year's tax cut discussions was $48 million in a show of good faith to study school financing and the role of property taxes.	1
I understand the strongly held beliefs of some in this room that we should eliminate school property taxes and ask Delaware taxpayers to assume all of those costs using state revenues.	0
I believe there are some school taxes that should be cut, and I will offer a proposal to reduce dramatically the property tax burden on our senior citizens.	1
But I continue to question the wisdom of eliminating altogether Delaware's school property taxes -- already among the lowest in the nation, and a stable revenue source in both good and bad times.	1
Before we take that step, we need to stop and ask ourselves: do we really want to increase state spending by more than a quarter of a billion dollars over the next five years without putting one extra dime to work in improving our classrooms?	0
We need to think long and hard before taking that step.	0
Next week, I will offer a balanced package of business and personal tax reductions that is sustainable, fair, and supportive of further economic growth in Delaware.	1
I look forward to working with the General Assembly on my ideas -- and on yours -- in the months ahead.	0
KEEPING OUR ECONOMY STRONG Our work in cutting taxes will help keep Delaware's economy strong in the future.	1
This week, the General Assembly began to consider another important piece of economic development legislation: electric deregulation.	1
The agreement hammered out over six months provides for significant residential rate reductions, consumer protection, and the opening up of competition for industrial, commercial and other users.	1
I believe it is a good deal for Delaware.	0
It will keep us competitive in the years ahead, and I urge its passage.	0
Staying competitive in a rapidly changing global economy depends on how well we anticipate new economic trends.	1
"Hockey great Wayne Gretzky once replied when asked why he excelled on the ice, ""I go where the puck will be -- not where it is."	1
The information technology initiative which we've launched with our high tech businesses, colleges, and universities is one important initiative that will enable Delaware's economy to go where the puck will be.	1
Similarly, the expansion of life sciences is about to usher in a new chapter in American industry.	1
Delaware has a unique opportunity to be at its forefront.	0
Two Delaware companies, duPont and Zeneca - the latter soon to become AstraZeneca -- are world leaders in life sciences.	1
By helping both to grow together in our state and creating in Delaware a life sciences corridor for the world, we could help to put little Delaware on the map - and on the radar screens of some of the most promising international companies in business today.	1
My budget will propose creating a new Economic Development 2000 Fund to help establish a Delaware Biotechnology Institute in partnership with the University of Delaware, Delaware State University, and Delaware Tech.	1
Even sooner, we will put forward a package of infrastructure improvements and economic incentives to attract and grow AstraZeneca in New Castle County.	1
We can do so in a way that creates open space and recreational opportunities for area residents at the same time -- providing a win-win situation that we cannot allow to pass us by.	0
FIGHTING CRIME We know what employers want to locate in our state: a quality workforce, excellent schools, and safe communities in which to live.	1
I have already cited the drop in crime throughout our state and some of the reasons why.	1
Two weeks ago, I announced that Operation Safe Streets would be expanded to Kent and Sussex Counties.	1
Soon, we will announce a new community probation policing system for our state that will allow for closer supervision of probationers -- the group most likely to commit additional crimes.	1
We have also designed a program to further break the cycle of crime by targeting probationers for drug testing, treatment, and real consequences for failing to remain drug-free.	1
I am convinced that aggressive probation policing -- coupled with drug treatment -- is a good crime prevention strategy.	0
So is creating more after-school and weekend activities for our youth.	0
Last year, I received a letter from, I believe, the police chief of Seaford.	1
He was writing to tell me that in the months following the opening of the Western Sussex Boys & Girls Club there, juvenile complaints dropped by over 60 percent.	1
Boys and Girls Clubs, the Y, PAL Centers and other youth programs throughout our state have a track record of success that we should build on.	1
In short, they help keep kids out of trouble.	1
I will ask the General Assembly to create a Youth Crime Prevention Fund, modeled after the successful Arts Stabilization Fund.	1
Its purpose would be to provide incentive grants -- on at least a 3:1 basis -- to expand these successful programs.	1
A state that's spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year to arrest and incarcerate adult offenders can afford to spend a few million dollars more to help keep kids off the street and on the right path in life.	1
I hope you'll join with me in this effort.	0
The coming year will also see heightened attention on the increasing incidence of domestic abuse -- particularly abuse against children.	1
Working with Chief Justice Veasey, I will propose legislation creating a Domestic Abuse Court Project to ensure that the state's response to all cases of domestic abuse are coordinated, timely, and effective.	1
No one in this room is left unmoved by the senseless deaths of children who are abused.	1
While we need to separate fact from fiction in how these tragedies are reported, we know one thing for sure: the job we are asking our Division of Family Services to do today is much different than when the Lt. Governor and I took office six years ago.	1
No longer an agency designed primarily to reunify families in distress, the Division is now increasingly expected to protect every child with whom it comes in contact.	1
Two years ago, the General Assembly passed the Child Protection Accountability Act to make clear that the safety of children is paramount in DFS cases.	1
This year, I am asking the General Assembly to pass three bills that will give the Division the powers and direction it needs to carry out its expanding role.	1
As we search for new leadership at the Division of Family Services, I have emphasized the need to make sure the policies we established in the 1997 law to protect children are followed up with clear and decisive action by caseworkers and their supervisors.	1
At the same time, it is imperative that we continue to improve the training of agency personnel, while reducing the turnover in their numbers caused by burnout on the job.	0
Doing these things will do more than enhance our expertise in identifying at-risk children before tragedies occur.	0
Doing these things will save lives.	0
KEEPING DELAWAREANS HEALTHY There's another more insidious -- but no less lethal -- threat to the lives of our children: tobacco.	1
We need to do more to keep our kids from getting hooked on it.	0
On this day in America, 3,000 children -- with an average age twelve-and-a-half -- will begin smoking.	1
At least 1,000 of them will end up dying from that choice.	1
Last week, I joined Senator Blevins, Representatives Capano and Maier, as well as Attorney General Brady, in supporting a new campaign to reduce teen smoking.	1
That campaign can be funded, in part, by the tobacco settlement worked out by the nation's attorneys general.	1
The settlement was an important turning point in tobacco litigation, and I want to thank our Attorney General for helping to make it possible.	1
How much money Delaware ultimately receives will depend on many things.	0
How the money will be spent will be debated for months.	0
But I do hope we can agree on one thing now: the money should be put in a Delaware Health Fund to expand health care coverage and keep Delawareans healthy.	0
I said earlier that Delaware's health care numbers are improving.	1
Used wisely, these funds can make Delaware a national leader in providing health care to our residents.	0
"Already there are creative ideas on the table: from completing universal health care coverage for children to a ""pill bill"" aimed at helping our senior citizens to handle the rising cost of prescription drugs."	1
Let me mention one other health care challenge we cannot ignore: Delaware's emergency medical system.	1
In November, a study I requested found that our EMS system is fragmented, costly, and inefficient.	1
The simple fact is that more lives could be saved with a more effective system.	0
I know that many good people -- professionals and volunteers -- are part of the EMS system.	1
I ask them to work with Public Safety Secretary Bushweller and the committee he has established to develop an action plan that will reduce response times and better serve Delawareans whose lives depend on them.	1
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT We all know that the health of every Delawarean is closely linked to a healthy environment.	0
In the 1990's -- governments in Delaware and around the country -- have tried to balance protection of our environment and natural resources with the need for a strong economy.	1
For the past six years, I have asked the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to work with polluters in an effort to find cost-effective, common sense solutions to reduce harmful emissions.	1
When those good intentions are rebuffed, we get tough.	0
It's a combination that has worked.	0
Today, we face a major challenge: how to preserve one of our state's major industries -- agriculture -- and improve water quality at the same time.	1
In short, here's the situation we face.	0
For every person living here in Delaware, there are about 300 chickens who call Delaware home, too -- at least for a couple of months.	1
Historically, the manure, or litter, from our feathered friends has been used to fertilize the hundreds of thousands of acres of cropland on the Delmarva Peninsula.	1
There, a lot of the corn and soybeans are grown to feed all of those chickens.	1
Since 1960, the number of acres of cropland across Delaware under cultivation has diminished by nearly one-third.	1
Meanwhile, the number of chickens raised in our state has almost tripled.	1
Today, we have more poultry litter than ever and fewer fields to spread it on.	1
When it rains, excess nutrients from the litter run off into ditches and streams -- resulting in more nitrogen and phosphorous than our waterways and groundwater ought to have. So much for the problem. What do we do about it?	1
First, we need to be honest and acknowledge that not all nutrient loading of our waterways and groundwater comes from farming operations.	1
Other sources, including wastewater treatment plants, lawns, golf courses, and runoff from roads and parking lots, contribute to this problem as well.	1
If we want to dramatically improve water quality, all of these sources must be addressed.	0
The cleanup plans for every Delaware waterway which we are developing with the EPA as part of the Clean Water Act will do that over the next 10 years.	1
In the shorter term, however, the harm caused by the over-application of poultry litter on fields cannot be ignored.	1
Our goal is to reduce the over-application of these nutrients.	1
"Now, there are some who believe that a regulatory approach requiring farmers to obtain ""industrial-strength"" permits is a large part of the solution."	0
With all due respect, that's a course of action which may well result in more lawsuits than clean water. So what do we do?	0
Several months ago, I charged an inter-agency team within my Administration with finding solutions for our nutrient overloading problem in Delaware.	1
They have worked with the agriculture advisory committee I created -- as well as with EPA, the large poultry integrators, environmentalists, the agriculture extension service and scientists, along with biotech companies like duPont.	1
Several of them even traveled to Europe in search of answers.	1
What is coming together is a plan of action that incorporates the best ideas from some of the smartest people around the world.	1
For example, research has shown that when a substance called phytase is introduced into chicken feed, the phosphorous coming out of the other end of those chickens is reduced by about 25 percent.	1
Already in Delaware, some of our chickens are eating feed that includes phytase.	1
In addition, integrators operating in Delaware will soon require their growers to develop nutrient management plans before those growers receive any additional chicks to raise.	1
Millions of state and federal dollars will be used to help build manure storage facilities at farms throughout Sussex and Kent Counties to prevent runoff.	1
We expect that millions of additional federal dollars will soon be coming to Delaware to create natural buffer strips between farm fields and waterways both large and small to keep nutrients out of the water.	1
The duPont Company and others are developing genetically-altered corn and other feeds that will result in less phosphorus in chicken litter.	1
We've also begun to explore another environmentally-safe, cost-effective use for poultry litter -- one that has been used effectively in Europe for years.	1
That's to incinerate it and transform it into energy.	1
Europe's experience has demonstrated that odors can be tightly controlled, even in an urban setting.	1
Stack gasses can be readily scrubbed to dramatically reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.	1
The byproduct of the incineration is a nitrogen-free ash that can be marketed for use where fertilizers are needed.	1
Last month, we began discussions with the leadership of Conectiv Power to explore whether a specially-designed boiler could be added to Conectiv's existing power plant in Vienna, Maryland or at its Indian River facility, for poultry litter incineration.	1
I have also contacted Maryland Governor Parris Glendening to explore with him whether this waste-to-energy initiative might hold promise as part of a peninsula-wide solution to nutrient management.	1
Early next month, Conectiv CEO Howard Cosgrove and I will meet with Governor Glendening to discuss how we might proceed.	1
"Finally, we will be discussing with legislators, integrators, and the nutrient management advisory committee the need for legislation similar to that which has been proposed in Virginia -- coupled with a provision to protect farmers and our environment from ""bad actors"" who won't do their part to solve this problem."	1
The actions I have outlined here will not all be easy or cheap.	0
But I am confident that the course we are taking will meet our twin objectives of cleaner water and a strong farm economy.	0
RAISING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT I want to take the rest of my time with you today to focus on the education of our children.	0
As leader of the National Governors' Association, I have made raising student achievement the focus of the NGA.	1
As governor, I have made education the focus of this administration.	1
Ensuring that young men and women graduate from our schools able to read and write, do math, work with computers, and be successful in life is the most important thing we are endeavoring to do in Delaware and in America.	1
The future of our youth literally depends on us.	0
When talk first began in Delaware six years ago about education reforms based on rigorous academic standards in math, science, English and social studies, a lot of people figured that this idea -- like most education fads -- would simply fade away. It did not.	1
When talk then began of developing high-stakes tests to measure student progress toward meeting rigorous academic standards, a lot of people said those tests would never be given. They were mistaken.	1
And finally, a lot of people never believed we would put in place an accountability system that provides real consequences -- positive and negative -- for students, schools, and school districts. We have.	1
Beginning with the start of the school year this coming September, the rubber really hits the road.	1
A new era of accountability in education begins in Delaware.	0
In the spring of 2000, students in grades 3, 5, 8, and 10 will take challenging tests -- called assessments -- in reading, writing, and math.	1
Students in grades 3 and 5, whose reading comprehension tests well below our standard, must attend summer school and hone their reading skills.	1
Students whose reading skills improve sufficiently will move on to the next grade.	1
Those who don't will repeat the same grade with a curriculum that focuses on reading.	1
Similar requirements apply to both reading and math in the 8th and 10th grades.	1
The focus on these two subjects is critical because, beginning with the class of 2002 -- this year's freshmen -- Delaware students must demonstrate that they have mastered our rigorous standards in order to receive a high school diploma.	1
If they fail to meet Delaware standards in reading or math by the end of the 12th grade, they may attend commencement exercises with the class of 2002.	1
They may even receive a certificate of completion.	1
But let me be clear: those students will not receive a diploma from the State of Delaware.	1
Schools and districts will also be held accountable.	1
The test scores from 1998 and 1999 will be used to establish baselines.	1
Two years from this spring -- in 2001 -- schools whose students show significant improvement will be rewarded with public recognition and monetary awards.	1
Conversely, schools whose students show no improvement or a decline face the loss of state accreditation and the wrath of parents.	1
We haven't chosen this path to be mean-spirited or hard-hearted.	0
We've chosen this path because it has succeeded in raising student achievement in other states, and it will help to raise student achievement in Delaware, too.	1
The assessments given last spring to 3rd, 5th, 8th, and 10th graders do more than show how our students measure up to Delaware standards.	1
A separate section of each test also shows how some 40,000 of our students measure up to their counterparts across the country in reading and in math.	1
Those results indicate that our students are -- by and large -- average.	1
Let me say again today, as I have said many times before: average is not good enough for Delaware.	0
If we want Delawareans to continue to enjoy a high standard of living in the next century, it won't be because our schools turn out students with average skills.	0
It will be because our schools graduate students with skills that will enable them and their employers to be successful in a rapidly changing, more challenging world.	0
It is our job to make sure that students gain those skills.	0
I want to ask each of you here today to join me in renewing our pledge to do what it takes to ensure that our students succeed.	0
As many of you know, our two children attend public schools.	1
Martha and I believe they are receiving an excellent education.	0
We're proud of our sons and we have every reason to believe that they will be able to meet Delaware's academic standards.	0
But, it's important to us - and I know to you -- that all Delaware students have a real chance to meet those standards.	0
Toward that goal, we must continue to make extraordinary investments in kids' lives -- not just after they enter our schools, but in the critical, formative years before they reach kindergarten.	0
Thanks to the consistent bipartisan support of both this House and Senate, we are combating teenage pregnancy, providing home visits for all first-time moms, and offering parenting training that includes parents on welfare and in our prisons, too.	1
We've dramatically expanded the availability of childcare for kids whose parents must work, and we've made it possible for all four- year-olds who live in poverty to participate in a Head Start program.	1
To help kids be successful once they get to school, we've provided additional teachers to lower class size.	1
We have funded an extra 20 instructional days for one out of three students between kindergarten and grade 12.	1
To better ensure that students gain the computer skills they'll need, a few months ago Delaware became the first state in the nation to wire every public school classroom with access to the Internet.	1
We have allocated 13 million extra dollars to attach computers to those wires.	1
Teachers are being trained to use this new technology to make learning more relevant for a generation of youngsters more comfortable holding a joystick than playing stickball.	1
On top of all that, scores of Delaware employers have adopted schools and are providing mentors in those schools.	1
This week, close to 10,000 mentors will work with students to help them meet our high standards. And you know what?	1
Those individual, personal efforts are paying off.	0
Among most students with mentors, academic performance and attendance are up.	1
Disruptive behavior and absenteeism are down.	1
Finally, we've introduced competition into our public schools through public school choice and charter schools.	1
Fully 10 percent of Delaware students -- the highest percentage of any state -- now exercise that choice.	1
In addition, growing numbers of Delaware students are enrolling in Delaware's public charter schools.	1
There, real school-based decision making is unleashing innovation and energy too rarely found in other schools -- public or private.	1
As a result, more charter schools are on the way.	1
We have laid a solid foundation.	0
It is time to build on that foundation and finish the job we've begun. What remains to be done?	0
School reforms won't be effective in classrooms that are too disruptive for teachers to teach and students to learn.	1
To help create disciplined classroom environments, we've initiated disruption prevention programs in every Delaware public school.	1
We've created alternative learning centers for chronically disruptive students in each of our counties.	1
Many elementary schools now have family crisis therapists, and a growing number of high schools have a school resource officer -- a state cop in plain clothes who is trained specifically to work with teens. It hasn't been enough.	1
This year, I will propose to increase by 50 percent what we currently spend on discipline.	1
We are awaiting the results of an evaluation of our existing discipline programs -- to find out what's working well and what's not.	1
With that information, I want us to expand -- statewide -- those programs that are successful at creating classrooms conducive to learning.	0
Too often, we hear that some children are not successful because schools cannot overcome the negative impact of society.	0
Current research disputes that, showing that teacher qualifications and class size together can have as great an impact on student achievement as poverty, race, and parent education combined.	1
Make no mistake about it - the success of education reform hinges on the quality of our teachers.	1
Thousands of dedicated teachers work in our schools every day.	1
Each year, we add hundreds of new teachers to those ranks.	1
Their skills are critical to the success of our students.	0
I believe that our efforts to reform education in Delaware hinge, in large part, on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled, competent teachers.	0
Toward that goal, I propose to adopt the recommendations of the Teacher Salary Schedule Improvement Committee, ably chaired over the last six months by Dr. Joe Pika.	1
Among those recommendations are the following ones: First, make salaries more competitive with others in our region - a 13 percent increase in pay for teachers in the first three years, with a four percent increase to more experienced teachers.	1
Second, encourage focused, career-long professional development for all teachers in three ways: 1) by phasing in five additional, paid work days over the next three years; 2) by compensating teachers for enhanced skills and knowledge; and 3) by paying more to teachers who work extra hours as academic leaders.	1
As we enhance compensation and work to provide quality professional development, we also must put in place policies that ensure high standards for becoming and remaining a teacher in Delaware.	1
Education Secretary Iris Metts and I will propose a plan for professional growth and accountability of our teachers.	1
First, and perhaps most importantly, we will propose -- for the first time -- to link teacher appraisal to student achievement.	1
I believe a significant portion of a teacher's evaluation should be based on how effective that teacher is in helping children to learn.	0
We will propose that at least 20 percent of a teacher's evaluation be based on student performance, along with 30 percent of an administrator's evaluation -- percentages that are among the highest of any state in America.	1
Secondly, we will propose to make it more challenging to earn a certificate to teach in Delaware.	1
Applicants will be required to pass a national exam that measures mastery of content knowledge and how to teach that content.	1
New teachers also will serve an induction period under the mentorship of an experienced teacher and must earn satisfactory appraisals that include evidence of improved student performance.	1
Third, we will propose to initiate a re-certification process to ensure that our teachers update and renew their skills.	1
Recertification will require ongoing professional development, combined with successful performance appraisals that are linked to student achievement.	1
If a teacher receives unsatisfactory evaluations, every effort will be made to improve that teacher's skills.	1
If, despite appropriate intervention, a teacher continues to receive unsatisfactory evaluations, that teacher will face the loss of his/her license to teach in Delaware.	1
We have a responsibility to better equip teachers with the skills to enable them to be effective in Delaware classrooms.	0
We also have the responsibility to ensure that every child has an effective teacher in their classroom.	0
These teacher compensation and professional accountability plans make clear once again that education reform is not a passing fad.	1
The course to which we are committed is a marathon -- not a sprint.	0
Our kids' futures are at stake.	0
So is the economic vitality of Delaware in the 21st century.	0
Delaware's children deserve nothing less than the best education our state can offer.	0
The responsibility to make that a reality for them rests with us.	0
CLOSE As I come to a close today, let me say that in spite of all that we've accomplished, I'm always struck by how much work there is left to do.	0
And it occurs to me that the reason is pretty simple: to stay ahead, we must keep moving forward.	0
I am proud of the record that our Administration and this legislature -- working with people throughout Delaware -- have put together over the past six years.	0
Our collective leadership has prepared this state well for a new century. Our economy is strong. Taxes are lower. Crime is decreasing. Health care is increasing.	1
Our schools are getting better.	0
Our environment is getting cleaner.	1
Many challenges await us, of course -- some of which I have outlined here today.	1
Let us dedicate ourselves to meeting those challenges with the same energy and enthusiasm, the same bipartisan spirit of cooperation, that has been our recipe for success these past six years.	1
Let the governor and legislature who are preparing to greet another new century, 100 years from now, say of us: they saw their future and reached out to embrace it. Thank you very much.	0
Lt. Governor Hall-Long, Mister Speaker, Mister President Pro Temp, Members of the 151st General Assembly, Members of the Cabinet, Distinguished members of the Judiciary, and my fellow Delawareans: Thank you for inviting me into the chamber today, and thank you for tuning in virtually during this very unusual time.	1
Section 15 of the Delaware Constitution reads as follows: The Governor shall, from time to time, give to the General Assembly information of affairs concerning the State and recommend to its consideration such measures as he or she shall judge expedient.	1
And so my task today is to give you, the General Assembly, the state of our state.	1
Over the course of this pandemic, and especially over the course of the past few weeks, we’ve all wrestled with existential questions for the state of the state, here in Delaware, and of course nationally.	1
What is the role of the state?What happens when life and liberty are in conflict?	0
What does it mean when those charged with safeguarding our nation’s democracy threaten it?	0
The past year brought us a once-in-a-generation public health crisis, civil unrest and racial tensions.	1
A contentious – but free and fair – election.	1
And a violent attempt to overturn that election.	1
It’s understandable then, to feel concerned about the state of our state.	0
Or that the state of our state is tenuous, weak, or even on the decline.	0
But I am here today to offer a clear counter message.	0
Over the past year Delawareans have worked hard, kept our focus, strengthened our resolve, and looked out for one another.	0
As a result of the good work of so many, I stand here confidently, proudly, and gratefully to tell you that the state of our state is resilient. It’s determined. It’s strong. And it is getting stronger. Let me explain.	0
I’ll start with the state of our budget and our economy.	0
When I stood in this chamber one year ago, we had a $200 million surplus.	1
By April, the economic downturn, brought on by the pandemic, had wiped out that surplus.	1
And like every state in the country, we faced a looming deficit.	1
But unlike most other states, Delaware was ready.	1
With your help, we spent the previous three years getting ready.	1
With many of you, I hosted town hall meetings in communities across our state.	1
We promised to build a long-term, sustainable budget.	1
A budget that would work for Delaware families. And we kept that promise.	0
We built up our reserves -- while making investments where needed the most.	1
When the COVID-19 crisis hit, we balanced our budget without cutting critical services.	1
Without raising taxes on Delaware families or businesses.	1
Without borrowing money to pay our bills.	1
And without laying off state employees or cutting their pay – as so many other states were forced to do.	1
Thanks in part to these responsible budgeting practices, Delaware maintained our Triple A bond rating while other states had their credit downgraded.	1
This year, I will again propose a budget that links state spending to the growth of our economy.	1
We’ll invest one-time money in one-time infrastructure projects.	1
We’ll focus on the future AND rebuild our reserves.	0
I ask the General Assembly to join me in this effort.	0
If you do, when the next crisis comes, Delaware will be ready again.	0
Th is last year h as been a very ch allen ging balancing act .	0
We have worked hard to protect public health, while protecting the health of our economy.	0
I’ve told Delawareans time and again -- we need a healthy community AND a healthy economy.	1
In spit e of a global economic downturn an d a pandemic, our unemployment rat e in Delaware is just over 5% now.	1
That is a positive sign for Delaware workers.	0
But we know that some have sacrificed more than others.	0
In March, restaurants workers across our state suffered a serious blow.	1
They faced the sudden loss of a job because of our COVID-19 restrictions.	1
Restaurant owners worried about the loss of a family-owned business.	1
The same is true for folks who make their living in bars, hotels, and arts venues.	1
In many ways, these places are the heart of our communities – and they drive our $3.5 billion tourism industry.	1
That’s why our state was one of the first states to step up and support them.	1
On March 18th, we launched our HELP program to offer financial relief to these businesses and their workers.	1
Over the course of the pandemic, Delaware has used nearly $200 million in federal CARES Act funding to support restaurants, bars, hotels, gyms and other small businesses.	1
We’ve used another $210 million to replenish the state’s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.	1
This will protect small businesses from a tax hike in the future that otherwise would be necessary.	1
We will continue to support these small businesses until they’re back on their feet.	1
Last year, despite the pandemic, we continued to fund the largest infrastructure program in the history of our state.	1
In Kent and Sussex counties, we have made it a priority to expand access to high- speed broadband and eliminate internet deserts.	1
In the past year, we expanded wireless broad band to over 500 Delawareans.	1
That number continues to grow each week.	1
During the pandemic, this work became more important than ever.	0
The Department of Education and DTI partnered to create the Connect Delaware program .	1
Through this program, we provided over 25,000 low-income students with reliable internet access.	1
And I want to thank Jason Clarke, our new Chief Information Officer, and his team for their hard work on this broadband initiative.	1
In July, we all put on our masks, and opened the Margaret Rose Henry Bridge in South Wilmington.	1
The bridge connects the Riverfront with development opportunities on the other side of the Christina.	1
It will also serve as an important connector for city neighborhoods.	1
And as a welcoming symbol for visitors to our City.	0
It is appropriately named for our good friend, former Senator, and a bridge-builder herself, Margaret Rose Henry.	1
These are the kind of projects that can revitalize communities, create jobs, spur growth, and new business investment.	1
We need to make it easy for businesses to start here, and stay here.	0
That’s why this year, I’m again proposing a Site Readiness Fund, so we can quickly convert existing properties to meet the needs of prospective employers.	1
Two years ago, we started a new grant program: Encouraging Development and Growth Expansion, or EDGE for short.	1
We’ve awarded nearly $1.5 million in EDGE Grants to 20 companies.	1
This year we’ll expand the EDGE grant program, to encourage even more small businesses to grow and innovate.	1
We’ll also increase funding for what we call Graduation Lab Space.	1
We have a number of start-up science and tech companies here in Delaware.	1
But we have a shortage of lab space for them to use as they grow their business.	1
We want to help the private sector build more lab space.	0
We want companies that start here to stay and grow here.	0
And we want to attract companies from the region to come to our state.	0
We know that the best path to a good job is a good education.	1
This past year has tested every aspect of our public school system.	1
And I want to thank our educators, school nurses, school an d district leaders, an d every single person who works in our schools.	0
They have met this challenge, and put the needs of their students above their own.	0
I also want to thank the parents, who filled in the gaps and kept their students on track at home, often while juggling remote work of their own.	0
My highest priority as Governor remains the same.	0
We need to ensure our most vulnerable students get t he edu cation they need and deserve.	0
Students who are living in poverty.	1
Students who are still learning English.	1
And I know it’s a priority for many of you.	0
That’s why we created the Opportunity Funding program – Delaware’s first weighted student funding system.	1
We designed the program to offer classroom- based support for low-income students and English learners.	1
And for the educators who work so hard with these students every day.	0
Over the next three years, we will more than double Opportunity Funding for public schools across the state.	1
Already, Opportunity Funding is making a difference for our most vulnerable st u dents.	1
In the Indian River district, this program paid for additional staff to help English learners at every grade level.	1
In the Capital School District, social workers and school counselors are supporting the social and emotional needs of students.	1
They’re working to ensure we meet the needs of the whole child.	1
In the Red Clay district, Opportunity Funding is providing new staff, new materials, and new programs for low-income students and English learners.	1
One of the best ways to help these students is to support them before they even start school.	0
That’s why we’ll also double funding for the Early Childhood Assistance Program in future years.	1
Th is will expand access to high quality early education programs for disadvantaged children.	1
We’re also committed to fully funding K-3 basic special education over the next few years.	1
I want to personally thank RepresentativeWilliams for her years of advocacy on this issue.	1
We will need the General Assembly’s support to make all of these investments a permanent reality.	1
Our students deserve nothing less.	0
I want to take a minute to thank my wife Tracey for her particular focus on the children who need our help the most.	1
She and her team through the First Chance Initiative have helped to make Delawarea more trauma-informed state.	1
They’ve helped ensure students were fed even when the pandemic meant they couldn’t come to school.	1
And through the Dolly Parton Imagination Library, over 13,000 children from birth to age five receive a new book in the mail every month.	1
The First Chance Initiative has been recognized nationally by the Casey Family Programs with the Excellence for Children Leadership award, an d the initiative h as been critical to our work here in Delaware.	1
Thank you, Tracey, for your dedication to giving every Delaware child a First Chance to succeed.	1
I also want to thank Lieutenant Governor Hall-Long for her work as Chair of the Behavioral Health Consortium.	1
She and her team continue to break down the stigma of substance use disorder and mental health challenges.	1
They’re providing families with resources and support.	1
And they’re distributing the life-saving drug,naloxone, to prevent overdose deaths.	1
During the COVID crisis, the Lieutenant Governor also led the effort to support homeless Delawareans.	1
She organized volunteers and went out on the street, herself, in full PPE to screen and test and then quarantine those who needed it.	1
This year laid bare the pain that our brothers and sisters of color suffer across our state and nation.	0
It took away any false sense of comfort we may have allowed ourselves to feel that everyone has equal access to the American Dream.	0
We have much work to do as a state and as a nation. First to heal. But to go beyond healing.	0
To make fundamental changes to a system that for too long has denied the promise of equality and justice for all.	0
This requires a comprehensive approach.	0
To the relationship between law enforcement and communities of color.	0
But also to economic empowerment, education, and issues of diversity and inclusion in the workplace.	0
I recently named former Secretary of Human Resources SandyJohnson as the Director of Statewide Equity Initiatives – a new position designed to make sure that we in state government are leading the way.	1
We’ve also worked hard to build a cabinet that looks like Delaware.	0
We created the position of Chief Diversity Officer to focus on recruitment and retention of a diverse state workforce.	1
I also want to congratulate the General Assembly.	0
Led by Senator Darius Brown, they’re one step away from a Constitutional amendment that will make it clear that here in Delaware, discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin is illegal, and will not be tolerated.	1
There are also very concrete things we can do to ensure that our brothers and sisters of color have a fair shot at the American dream.	0
The Port of Wilmington is one of a handful of ports in the country with a predominantly African American workforce.	1
Now we’re building a new port at Edgemoor.	1
This will create thousands of additional good-paying jobs.	1
African American-owned businesses make up 11 percent of businesses in our state.	1
They make up 16 percent of the businesses that got COVID Relief Grants from the state.	1
We’re also using CARESAct money to put 3,000out-of-workDelawareans through a rapid retraining program to get them back on their feet.	1
Over half of enrollees are people of color.	1
Last year, led by Senator Lockman and Representative Chukwuocha, we banned choke holds.	1
This year, we will support a plan to get body cameras for every police officer in the state.	1
There is so much more work to be done, but we have made important progress this year.	0
A critical part of making life better for Delawareans is protecting our environment.	0
Last year, the legislative session was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as we know.	1
But I made a promise to my friend, and former Senator Harris McDowell.	1
I promised we would put the finishing touch on his legacy here in the legislature and set a Renewable Portfolio Standard this year.	1
And so with your help, we will set a new goal that 40 percent of Delaware’s energy will come from renewable sources by 2035.	1
We made a lot of promises before the pandemic last year. And I intend to keep them.	1
We’ll again propose a $50 million investment in a new Clean Water Trust Fund.	1
We will make sure that all Delaware families have access to clean drinking water.	1
And we will place a special focus on those hard-to-serve communities across our state.	1
Delaware’s constitution and our oaths of office call on us to protect these natural resources for future generations.	1
With the leadership of House Majority Leader Longhurst and Senate Majority Leader Townsend, the Delaware Nature Society and so many others -- we will do just that.	1
Of course, we can’t do any of the things I just mentioned unless we beat this pandemic.	0
To date, 1,049 Delawareans have died of the deadly virus.	1
Each one was a precious life, with family and friends.	0
More than 7 percent of our population has been infected with COVID-19. The virus is real. And it’s very serious.	1
Over the course of my 30 years in public service, and even during the course of this administration, I have seen government tackle countless, serious and complicated challenges.	1
Nothing – absolutely nothing – compares to the last ten months.	0
There are state employees in every corner of this government who have been asked to solve unimaginable problems, work punishing hours, and put themselves in harm’s way, to help us get through this pandemic.	0
Last spring, I asked Lt. Governor Hall-Long and Secretary of State Bullock to lead our Pandemic Resurgence Advisory Committee.	1
They listened to the firsthand accounts of Delawareans affected by COVID-19.	1
They helped us develop a plan to protect our health and support our economy.	1
And so, to the nurses and the team at the Veterans Home, the Psychiatric Center, the Home for the Chronically Ill, Stockley, and hospitals throughout the state.	1
To the correctional officers, probation and parole, and youth rehabilitation staff.	0
To the educators and school nurses.	0
To the child care providers who have supported our youngest learners throughout the pandemic.	1
To the unemployment office at the Department of Labor.	1
To the Delaware State Police, DATE, DNREC park rangers and the Attorney General’s Office.	1
To the Department of Elections.	0
To the restaurant inspectors and the team at the State Health Operations Center.	1
To DEMA and the Delaware National Guard.	1
To the entire team at the Division of Public Health. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.	1
Most Delawareans will never know all that you’ve done and sacrificed to keep them safe. But I know. And I am grateful.	0
This time last year, most of us had never heard of the novel coronavirus.	1
Today, we’re testing 200,000 Delawareans a month.	1
We’ve processed unemployment claims for 120,000 Delaware workers.	1
We’ve allocated more than $900 million in CARES Act funding.	1
And we’ve administered nearly 70,000 life-saving vaccines.	1
There is a long long road ahead of us. But we have turned the corner.	0
Thank you, Delawareans, for doing your part.	0
One of the most important things we did during this pandemic was safeguard our democracy.	0
With the General Assembly’s help, we allowed mail-in voting for the first time.	1
That meant hundreds of thousands of Delawareans could stay safe from the pandemic, while exercising their right to vote.	1
And I look forward to signing legislation to make mail-in voting a permanent feature of our elections – from school board and town hall elections to the election for the President of the United States.	1
Governments at all levels made it possible for public meetings, hearings and proceedings to be conducted virtually during the pandemic.	1
In many cases it’s made conducting the public’s business more accessible, more transparent, and more efficient.	1
We should all want more people to participate in our democracy – not fewer.	0
So we should work together to make these practices permanent even after the pandemic.	0
This year has taken a toll on each of us.	0
And our state has had to withstand enormous pressure and strain.	0
But we as a state have survived.	0
We’ve proven that if we each do our part, together, we can get through this. Hope is here.	0
We’re getting the vaccine to as many Delawareans, as fast as we can.	1
And we have a new President who we all know so well, and we know we can trust. We will get through this.	1
And with your help, in this next year, we will thrive.	0
The pandemic has affected each of us differently.	1
But it’s affected each of us one way or another. We all have that in common.	1
For me, it’s made me even more grateful to live in a state of neighbors.	0
To have a state workforce full of grit and compassion.	0
And to have the privilege of leading nearly a million Delawareans who have looked out for one another, who have done the right thing, and who have kept the faith that better days are just on the horizon.	1
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless our great state.	0
Good evening, fellow Hoosiers, colleagues, and friends.	0
Speaker Gregg, Senator Garton, Representative Bosma, Senator Young, Chief Justice Shepard and Chief Judge Sharpnack, thank you for hosting this joint session.	1
I want to thank my best friend, my wife, Judy, for all she does for me and for Indiana.	1
And special thanks to my partner, Lieutenant Governor Joe Kernan.	1
You've been a friend to me and all of Indiana, Joe.	0
You've done an outstanding job, and I look forward to working with you over the next four years to keep Indiana in a State of Progress.	0
I sense tonight many of the same feelings of gratitude, privilege, humility and honor I felt when I first entered the Indiana Statehouse as a newly elected State Senator.	1
And, I'm sure you have similar feelings.	0
As your governor, I am pleased to report tonight on the State of our State.	0
Indiana has had unprecedented economic growth and prosperity over the past decade.	1
And we have responded in a strong and responsible manner.	0
In just the past four years we have invested record amounts in our public schools, our colleges and universities, and our roads and bridges.	1
And, we have returned $1.5 Billion to Hoosier taxpayers.	1
We have managed the state's finances well.	1
We are able to borrow at favorable interest rates because Wall Street has continuously given us higher credit ratings.	1
We have helped grow more than 150,000 new jobs, and we have among the lowest unemployment in the nation.	1
But now, the national economy is cooling down and so is Indiana's record growth.	1
The growth of our state sales and income tax revenues has slowed.	1
A new forecast projected that we will be $250 Million below our previous estimates for the fiscal year ending in June.	1
This shortfall results in a compounded impact of $800 Million through the next biennium.	1
The beginning proposal that I presented to the Budget Committee is balanced and reflects our current economic situation.	1
I have asked my legislative team to work with members of the House and Senate to pass a budget that is fiscally sound, balanced, and reflects my spending priorities.	1
They are: Continuing to improve our public schools Supporting our most vulnerable Hoosiers Making sure our working men and women have 21st Century skills; and Continuing important state services.	1
These are my spending priorities based on our available revenues.	1
Because our economy is cooling down, our reserve is precariously low.	1
Most of that reserve -- about $600 Million in the Rainy Day Fund and $265 Million in the Tuition Support Fund -- cannot be used unless certain conditions are met.	1
That is why I am proposing that we use $410 Million of surplus gaming money to pay for some of these priority spending items and help us get through this economic slowdown.	1
In the early 1990s, we used over $340 Million of lottery monies to help fund our schools tuition support program.	1
So, there is legislative precedent for the temporary use of these funds for education.	1
Our first challenge this year is to work within our budgetary constraints while focusing on our most important priorities.	1
EDUCATION To do that, we need to start with education.	0
I want to look back for a moment on where we started before addressing where we need to go.	0
In 1996, Governor Bayh met with the nation's governors and business leaders at the National Education Summit.	1
That summit launched a national commitment to standards-based education reform -- a commitment that we have honored here in Indiana.	1
When I attended the same conference in 1999 with Superintendent Suellen Reed, the focus was on quality teaching and professional development.	1
In talking with governors, business leaders, parents, teachers and administrators, it became clear that money spent is not the sole means to higher student achievement.	1
Rather, focus, commitment, consensus, and cooperation are the essential ingredients of real reform.	0
Thats why I asked Dr. Reed to join me in creating the Education Roundtable.	1
The Roundtable brought together our business, education and community leaders in one room for a common goal: to improve Indiana's education.	1
We asked all participants to check their politics at the door. And they did.	1
The Roundtable first focused on essentials for higher student achievement: high standards, assessment and accountability.	1
The result: Indiana now has one of the most comprehensive assessment and accountability systems in the nation.	1
Plus, our new school accountability laws require schools to make continuous improvements while giving them the flexibility to determine how to meet their goals.	1
But nothing has been more dramatic than the changes in standards that the Roundtable recommended and the Board of Education implemented.	1
Before the creation of the Roundtable, experts characterized our standards as weak and confusing. In fact. before the Roundtable.	1
the Fordham Foundation gave Indiana an F for English and a C for math.	1
So, we worked together to rewrite those standards.	1
The result: We now have some of the highest English and math standards in the nation.	1
And the Fordham Foundation now gives Indiana standards an A for English, an A for math, and an A for science.	1
Another independent national organization dedicated to improving schools had this to say about us: Indiana is leading the way to world-class standards and performance under the guidance of the Roundtable.	1
Our greatest achievement the past four years has been changing the direction of our public schools.	1
Clearly, Indiana's new student standards and accountability system are the biggest steps to school improvement since Governor Orr' s A-plus plan.	1
These achievements would have not been possible without the stellar work of the Education Roundtable.	0
So tonight, I invited each of them to join us so that we can all express our appreciation for their hard work.	1
I would like to ask Dr. Reed and the members of the Education Roundtable to stand. Make no mistake.	1
The Roundtable's work is not done.	1
It is now helping re-write our geography, economics, civics and history standards so they too will be among the highest in the nation.	1
And it is now focusing on quality teaching.	1
While we have made progress by setting historic standards, we still have a long way to go.	0
If we are to continue to improve our schools, we must enact additional legislation this session.	0
We must invest in school readiness so our first graders can meet the highest English and math standards in the country.	0
My $50 Million school readiness program offers flexibility for schools to meet local needs -- like full day kindergarten, moving the kindergarten entry date or programs like head start, or pre-school.	1
Of course, no discussion on improving education is complete without a focus on reading.	0
If our new English standards are to be successful, our children must learn to read at grade level by the third grade.	1
Tonight I am asking you to support the most comprehensive reading and math initiative in Indiana history.	1
My Ready to Read initiative includes funding for reading assessments, summer programs, reading institutes, and a tutor for every child struggling to read.	1
Since our children will now be required to meet the highest math standards in the country, Algebra will be the key to their success.	1
That's why I have proposed a middle school summer math program to expand learning time. But that's not all.	1
Within this $50 Million initiative, we will also create 500 master reading and math teachers in the schools that need them the most.	1
These master teachers will receive training over the summer and return to their schools to raise reading and math achievements.	1
And the 50 schools that make the most improvement in reading and math will be rewarded.	1
Our students must not only be good scholars but good citizens.	0
That's why we need to support character education.	0
Through our safe haven school program, character is being taught not only during school, but before and after school as well.	1
Let's continue that progress by continuing to fund Indiana's Safe Haven schools.	1
And now that we have raised our standards, we are turning our attention to professional development and to quality teaching.	1
The Roundtable recognizes that our teachers need to be the best if our schools are to be the best.	1
Tonight, I am proposing a $30 million quality teaching initiative.	1
This program will fund professional development for teachers in the following areas: Reading and Math achievement Classroom management and discipline National Board Certification Character education.	1
Friends, I want to make it clear how important this investment is to our children's success.	0
We need a budget that pays for the professional development that our teachers need and that our children deserve.	0
This should be a top legislative priority and we must fund this program.	0
In recent years, we have given our schools greater flexibility to address their local needs.	1
The time has come to expand that flexibility.	0
Every session we get a little closer to passing charter school legislation.	1
Let's pass a charter schools bill this session and get this job done.	1
Last year, Indiana also took an important step in promoting lifelong learning and in re-training Hoosier workers by opening a Community College system.	1
I urge you to support additional community college sites over the next biennium.	0
We must also continue to support our great public universities so they can continue world-class research while also preparing students to compete in a global economy.	0
21st CENTURY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY FUND I also ask you tonight to continue the success of the 21st Century Research and Technology Fund.	1
We created the fund to stimulate economic development by supporting cutting edge research.	1
And it's already doing just that.	1
We've funded over 30 projects for private companies in partnership with our outstanding universities.	1
All across Indiana, advances are being made in agricultural genomics, tissue engineering, engine design, high speed Internet video, and other important areas.	1
Indiana is reaping the rewards of our investments, and we can't stop now.	0
We need to reauthorize the 21st Century Research and Technology Fund and invest $50 Million in it over the next two years.	1
I also encourage our public pension boards to invest a portion of their funds in private security equities to increase the return on their investment and spur growth in new companies.	1
A very conservative estimate suggests just a two percent investment could result in $300 Million for new venture capital and other investment options.	1
And, let's pass daylight saving time to help Indiana compete in the 21st Century economy.	1
SKILLS 2016 While we need to continue our support of high-tech companies, let's also address the needs of the many Hoosiers who work in manufacturing, health care and other sectors of our economy.	1
Our Advance Indiana and Training 2000 programs provide support to Indiana companies to train workers in rapidly advancing technologies.	1
These state training programs have helped over 700 Hoosier companies keep nearly 200,000 workers on the cutting edge of technologies. But we need to do more.	1
Through the new Skills 2016 Program, we will take our state training programs to a new level and allow Hoosier workers to share in our plan to build a better Indiana.	1
I appreciate your support of these initiatives.	0
And I urge your passage of the 2016 Skills Program to help Hoosier workers.	1
CROSSROADS 2000 Just as our investments in Hoosier companies and workers have paid off, so have our infrastructure investments.	1
Our Crossroads 2000 program was the largest single infrastructure investment in Indiana history.	1
With your help, we've built and improved roads and bridges throughout the state of Indiana.	1
And with an additional $310 Million in bonding capacity, we will continue this program through the biennium.	1
HOOSIER HEALTHWISE, HOOSIER RX With your support, we've also been able to enroll more than 150,000 children in Hoosier Healthwise, giving them access to health insurance.	1
And, nearly 4,000 of our lowest income seniors are getting help with prescription drugs thanks to HoosierRx.	1
And we expect 20,000 more seniors to be enrolled by the end of this year.	1
I'm also convinced we made the right choice when we agreed to use virtually all of our tobacco settlement money for health initiatives.	1
We must continue to fund these programs.	1
And, I urge you to use a portion of those funds to help our most vulnerable citizens our developmentally and mentally disabled Hoosiers live new lives outside of institutions and reach their full potential.	0
REASSESSMENT Another challenge ahead is complying with court-ordered reassessment.	1
Our State Tax Board is putting together a rule that complies with the court order.	1
This rule will be in place this spring.	1
And, although the effect will not be felt immediately, once implemented it will have a dramatic impact on some households.	1
So, we must put politics aside and work together on this issue for Hoosier homeowners, farmers and businesses.	0
My Taxpayers' Protection Plan, which I proposed a year ago, should be considered in your deliberations.	1
IURC We've talked a lot about difficult choices tonight.	0
But here's a choice that shouldn't be difficult at all: Let's give the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission the power other states have and Indiana needs to impose fines or other sanctions against public utilities that don't give Indiana customers reliable service.	1
Let's also give the IURC the authority it needs to review utility holding company mergers so it can better protect Hoosier ratepayers.	1
COMMUNITY Together, we have done much to build a better Indiana.	0
Community service is part of our history as Hoosiers.	0
I've seen it in every corner of the state.	1
Volunteers, working together, to make their neighborhoods cleaner, safer and more civil.	1
Private citizens, working together, to help build a new state museum because they understand the importance of respecting and cultivating our heritage.	1
And, led by our First Lady, more than 160 millennium communities have implemented programs to meet goals by the year 2016 to build a better Indiana.	1
We build a better Indiana: When we protect our air and our drinking water, go after polluters and take care of our environment When we pass legislation to lower the Blood Alcohol Content to .08 When we pass a constitutional curfew law When we use tobacco settlement money to expand community care for our most vulnerable citizens When we improve our CHOICE program for in-home care for our elderly When we give Hoosiers safer working conditions, better workers' compensation, and meaningful unemployment benefits When we support the Indiana Land Resource Council in preserving family farms, protecting open spaces and providing for continued economic growth When we support existing Indiana businesses facing challenges, such as our steel industry When we pass my school improvement plan And when we establish lifelong learning as our standard for all Hoosiers.	1
CONCLUSION Last November, Hoosiers went to the polls and elected us to represent them.	1
During the campaigns that led up to the election, we spent a lot of time talking -- often passionately -- about different issues.	1
Now that the voters have spoken, we need to put partisan rancor behind us and take up the people's work.	1
Hoosiers want cooperation, not conflict.	0
They want action, not acrimony.	0
At the end of the day, Hoosiers, not Democrats, Republicans, Independents, or Libertarians , but Hoosiers.	0
must work together to build a better Indiana.	0
The men and women who founded this great state in 1816 faced new challenges and adapted to change to build a better Indiana. So have we.	1
Together, we have done much to make Indiana a better place to live and work.	0
Tonight, I ask you to continue to put Indiana first as we all work together for a better Indiana. Thank you and good night.	0
Mr. Speaker, members of the Assembly, Hoosier friends and neighbors, thank you yet again for the privilege of this platform.	1
For most of us, one of the strongest memories of our youth is that great school teacher, that magical man or woman who somehow reached us, and stretched us, and in the process left indelible recollections.	0
For me, one of those was Bob Watson — still, today, Mr. Watson to me — who introduced us to the mysteries of the periodic table in high school chemistry.	1
In addition to mixing potions that suddenly turned purple, and terrifying pop quizzes, Mr. Watson was famous for his aphorisms, little sayings so often repeated that his students still smile and recite them to each other decades later.	1
And the most frequently applied of all Watson’s wisdoms was: “Good things come to those who wait.	1
Patience is the essence of life.	0
Patience does not come easily to a teenager. Or to adults, for that matter.	0
At the grocery store, the airport scanner, or the BMV, none of us likes to wait.	1
Like all Americans, Hoosiers are waiting tonight for a national economic recovery.	0
Far too many are without work and, even worse than their number, is how long many have been waiting, waiting for that next job, waiting for the basic human fulfillment of knowing you are standing on your own feet, providing for yourself and your family.	0
The deep frustration of unemployed Hoosiers is shared by those of us charged with public duties in these times.	0
The best efforts of our state, or any one state, to break free of recession’s suffocating clutch, are never adequate, and we can't wait for better times.	0
Building one of the best job climates in the country isn’t enough.	1
Breaking the all-time record for new job commitments isn't enough.	1
Adding new jobs at twice the national average isn’t enough.	1
We did all those things in 2010, but it couldn’t offset the terrible drag of a national economic ebb tide that continues to leave too many boats stuck in the muck.	1
We Hoosiers don't like to wait, when we can act.	0
If we cannot overcome a nationwide job hemorrhage, we can fight back better than others.	0
Again in 2010, we broke all records for road building and bridge building, for the fourth year in a row, and put thousands to work doing so.	1
As the final installment of our 2008 property tax cuts took effect, hard-pressed Hoosier home and business owners found an additional $600 million still in their bank accounts.	1
Tonight, because of our action, Indiana’s property taxes are the lowest anywhere in America.	1
And thanks to a ringing 72 percent verdict by our fellow citizens, who voted in referendum to protect those cuts in our constitution, they’re going to stay that way.	1
And in the clearest example of Hoosier resolve, we handled a two billion dollar drop in state revenues as any family would, as any small business would.	1
We decided what is most important, separated the “must do’s” from the “nice to do’s,” and matched spending to income.	1
Across the country, state spending, despite the recession, is still up sharply the last six years.	1
But here, it is virtually flat, one-third the rate of inflation.	1
Elsewhere, state government payrolls have grown, but here, we have the nation's fewest state employees per capita, fewer than we did in 1978.	1
During this terrible recession, at least 35 states raised taxes, but Indiana cut them.	1
Since '04, the other 49 states added to their debt, by 40 percent; we paid ours down, by 40 percent.	1
Many states exhausted any reserves they may have had, and plunged into the red, but our savings account remains strong, and our credit AAA.	1
What we did in 2008, and 2009, and 2010, we will do again this year.	0
We will take the actions necessary to limit state spending to the funds available.	0
We will protect struggling taxpayers against the additional burden of higher taxes.	1
We will continue improving our jobs climate by holding the line on taxes as our competitors take the easy way and let theirs rise.	1
We say tonight, whatever course others may choose, here in Indiana we live within our means, we put the private sector ahead of government, the taxpayer ahead of everyone, and we will stay in the black, whatever it takes.	0
In two days, I will send to this Assembly a proposed budget for the next biennium.	1
As always, I know that our final product will be a mutual one, and I welcome your amendments and improvements, so long as they live up to the following principles: One, I just mentioned; no tax increases. Can I get an “amen” to that?	1
Two, we must stay in the black at all times, with positive reserves at a prudent level throughout the time period.	0
Three, the budget must come into structural balance, meaning that no later than its second year, annual revenues must exceed annual spending, with no need for any use of our savings account. Four, no gimmicks.	1
We put an end to practices like raiding teacher pension funds, and shifting state deficits to our schools and universities by making them wait until the state had the cash to pay them.	1
That’s a form of waiting we should never impose again.	0
And, to hasten the return of an even stronger fiscal position, I again ask you to vote for lasting spending discipline by enacting an automatic taxpayer refund.	1
When the day comes again when state reserves exceed 10 percent of annual needs, it will be time to stop collecting taxes and leave them with the people they belong to.	1
Remember what the Hoosier philosopher said: “It's tainted money. ‘Taint yours, and ‘taint mine.	0
Beyond some point, it is far better to leave dollars in the pockets of those who earned them than to let them burn a hole, as they always do, in the pockets of government.	0
Doing the people’s business while living within the people’s means is our fundamental duty in public service.	0
Redrawing our legislative lines without gerrymandering, and adjusting an out of balance Unemployment Insurance system, are other examples of duties we must meet this year. I know you'll do so, head on.	0
So we had a little election last November.	1
It changed a few things, like the seating arrangement in this chamber.	1
One thing it didn’t change at all: our common duty to take every action possible to make this a better state, a more progressive state, a standout and special and distinctive state.	0
That election, like all elections, was not a victory for one side, it was an instruction to us all.	0
It was not an endorsement of a political party, it was an assignment to everyone present.	0
By itself, it accomplished nothing, but it threw open the door to great accomplishment.	0
Starting tonight, we must step through that door, together.	0
One opportunity lies in reform of our criminal justice system.	1
Helped by the nation's most respected experts, a bipartisan task force of police, judges, prosecutors, and others fashioned a package of changes to see that lawbreakers are incarcerated in a smarter way, one that matches their place of punishment to their true danger to society.	1
We can be tougher on the worst offenders, and protect Hoosiers more securely, while saving a billion dollars the next few years.	0
Let's seize this opportunity, without waiting.	0
Two years ago, the bipartisan commission led by two of Indiana’s most admired leaders presented to us a blueprint to bring Indiana local government out of the pioneer days in which it was created and into the modern age.	1
Of their 27 proposals, seven have been enacted in some form.	1
That leaves a lot of work to do. Indiana is waiting.	0
Some of the changes are so obvious that our failure to make them is a daily embarrassment.	0
The conflict of interest when double-dipping government workers simultaneously sit on city or county councils, interrogating their own supervisors and deciding their own salaries, must end.	1
The same goes for the nepotism that leads to one in four township employees sharing a last name with the politician who hired them.	1
Township government, which does not exist in most states, made some sense on the Indiana frontier.	1
Many township lines were laid out to accommodate the round-trip distance a horse could travel in a day.	1
We’ve come a little ways since then.	0
Today, over 4,000 politicians, few of them known to the voters they represent, run over a thousand different township governments.	1
They are sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in reserves.	1
Some have eight years of spending needs stashed in the bank, yet they keep collecting taxes.	1
Some townships are awash in money, while the township next door does not have enough to provide poor relief to its needy citizens.	1
Adjacent townships each buy expensive new fire trucks when one would suffice to cover them both.	1
Those serving in township government are good people, and well motivated.	0
We thank them for their service.	0
Our problem lies not with those holding all these offices, but with the antique system that keeps them there.	1
I support the clear and simple recommendation of the Kernan-Shepard Commission that we remove this venerable but obsolete layer of government, and assign what little remains of its duty to elected city and county officials.	1
Likewise, our strange arrangement of a three-headed county executive should change.	1
No business has three CEOs; no football team has three head coaches; no military unit would think of having three coequal commanding officers.	1
We should join the rest of America in moving to a single, elected county commissioner, working with a strengthened legislative branch, the County Council, to make decision making accountable and implementation swift and efficient.	0
As in the last two sessions, I look forward to constructive cooperation with the Assembly in bringing reform about.	1
The only outcome that is unacceptable is no action at all.	0
Hoosiers have waited for decades for our governmental design to catch up to society.	0
Let’s not keep them waiting any longer.	0
In no realm is our opportunity larger than in the critical task of educating our children.	0
The need for major improvement, and the chance for achieving it, is so enormous tonight that opportunity rises to the level of duty.	0
Advocates of change in education become accustomed to being misrepresented.	0
If you challenge the fact that forty-two cents of the education dollar are somehow spent outside the classroom, you must not respect school boards.	1
If you wonder why doubling spending didn’t produce any gains in student achievement, you must be criticizing teachers.	1
If your heart breaks at the parade of young lives permanently handicapped by a school experience that leaves them unprepared for the world of work, you must be “anti-public schools.	0
So let’s start by affirming once again that our call for major change in our system of education, like that of President Obama, his education secretary and so many others, is rooted in a love for our schools, those who run them and those who teach in them.	1
But it is rooted most deeply in a love for the children whose very lives and futures depend on the quality of the learning they either do or do not acquire while in our schools.	1
Nothing matters more than that.	0
Nothing compares to that Some seek change in education on economic grounds, and they are right.	0
To win and hold a family-supporting job, our kids will need to know much more than their parents did.	0
I have seen the future competition, every time I go abroad in search of new jobs for our state, in the young people of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China.	1
Let me tell you — those kids are good. They ought to be.	0
They are in school, not 180 days a year like here, but 210, 220, 230 days a year.	1
By the end of high school, they have benefited from two or three years more education than Hoosier students.	1
Along the way, they have taken harder classes.	0
It won’t be easy to win jobs away from them.	0
It’s not just tomorrow’s jobs that are at stake.	0
The quality of Indiana education matters right now.	0
When we are courting a new business, right behind taxes, the cost of energy, reasonable regulation, and transportation facilities comes schools.	1
“What kind of school will my children, and our workers’ children attend?” is a question we’re always asked.	0
Sometimes, in some places, it costs us jobs today. There is no time to wait.	0
In 1999, Indiana passed a law that said schools must either improve their results or be taken over by new management.	1
The little ones who entered first grade then, full of hope and promise, are eighteen now.	1
In the worst of our districts, half of them will not be graduating.	1
God bless and keep them, wherever they are and whatever life now holds for them.	0
For those children, we waited too long.	0
And it's not just about the most failing of our schools.	0
The last couple years have seen some encouraging advances, after years of stagnation.	0
But the brute facts persist: only one in three of our children can pass the national math or reading exam.	1
We trail far behind most states and even more foreign countries on measures like excellence in math: at the recent rate of improvement, it would take twenty-one years for us to catch Slovenia, and that’s if Slovenia stands still. That’s too long to wait.	1
That's too many futures to lose.	0
In every discussion, someone says “This is very complicated.	0
Then someone says, “These changes won't be perfect,” and then you hear “The devil is in the details. All true.	0
But we can no longer let complexity be an excuse for inaction, nor imperfection the enemy of the good.	0
When it comes to our children's future, the real devil is not in the details, he's in the delay, and 2011 is the year the delay must end. We know what works.	0
It starts with teacher quality.	1
Teacher quality has been found to be twenty times more important than any other factor, including poverty, in determining which kids succeed.	1
Class size, by comparison, is virtually meaningless.	1
Put a great teacher in front of a large class, and you can expect good results.	0
Put a poor teacher in front of a small class, do not expect the kids to learn.	0
In those Asian countries I mentioned, classrooms of thirty-five students are common, and they‘re beating our socks off.	1
We won’t have done our duty here until every single Indiana youngster has a good teacher every single year.	0
Today, 99 percent of Indiana teachers are rated “effective.	1
If that were true, 99 percent, not one-third, of our students would be passing those national tests.	1
Today’s teachers make more money not because their students learned more but just by living longer and putting another certificate on the wall.	1
Their jobs are protected not by any record of great teaching but simply by seniority.	1
We have seen “teachers of the year” laid off, just because they weren’t old enough. This must change. We have waited long enough.	1
Teachers should have tenure, but they should earn it by proving their ability to help kids learn.	0
Our best teachers should be paid more, much more, and ineffective teachers should be helped to improve or asked to move.	0
Today, the outstanding teacher, the Mr. Watson whose kids are pushed and led to do their best, is treated no better than the worst teacher in the school.	1
That is wrong; for the sake of fairness and the sake of our children, it simply has to end. We have waited long enough.	0
We are beginning to hold our school leaders accountable for the only thing that really matters: Did the children grow? Did the children learn?	1
Starting this year, schools will get their own grades, in a form we can all understand: ‘A’ to ‘F.	1
There will be no more hiding behind jargon and gibberish But, in this new world of accountability, it is only fair to give our school leadership full flexibility to deliver the results we now expect.	0
Already, I have ordered our Board of Education to peel away unnecessary requirements that consume time and money without really contributing to learning.	1
We are asking this Assembly to repeal other mandates that, whatever their good intentions, ought to be left to local control.	1
I am a supporter of organ donation, and cancer awareness, and preventing mosquito-borne disease, but if a local superintendent or school board thinks time spent on these mandated courses interferes with the teaching of math, or English, or science, it should be their right to eliminate them from a crowded school day.	1
And, while unions and collective bargaining are the right of those teachers who wish to engage in them, they go too far when they dictate the color of the teachers’ lounge, who can monitor recess, or on what days the principal is allowed to hold a staff meeting.	1
We must free our school leaders from all the handcuffs that reduce their ability to meet the higher expectations we now have for student achievement.	0
Lastly, we must begin to honor the parents of Indiana.	0
We must trust them, and respect them enough, to decide when, where, and how their children can receive the best education, and therefore the best chance in life.	0
Visiting with high school seniors, I discovered one new option we should be offering.	1
A significant fraction of our students complete, or could complete, their graduation requirements in well under twelve years.	1
We should say to these diligent young people, and their families, if you choose to finish in eleven years instead of twelve, we will give you the money we were going to spend while you cruised through twelfth grade, as long as you spend that money on some form of further education.	0
In this year’s survey of high school students, three out of four said they would like to have that option.	1
Let’s empower our kids to defray the high cost of education through their own hard work, by entrusting them with this new and innovative choice.	0
Another new kind of choice has come to Indiana parents the last couple years, as a byproduct of our property tax reductions.	1
Families are now able to choose public schools outside the districts they reside in, tuition-free.	1
Schools have begun advertising campaigns, touting their graduation rates and higher test scores.	1
This competition is a highly positive development, as long as it is fair.	0
I ask you to protect our families against any possibility of discrimination by requiring that any school with more applicants than room fill it through a lottery or other blind selection process.	0
Indiana has lagged sadly behind other states in providing the option of charter schools.	1
We must have more of them, and they must no longer be unjustly penalized.	0
They should receive their funding exactly when other public schools do.	1
If they need space, and the local district owns vacant buildings it has no prospect of using, they should turn them over.	0
Widening parents’ options in these ways will enable the vast majority of children to attend the school of their choice.	1
But one more step is necessary: For families who cannot find the right traditional public school, or the right charter public school for their child, and are not wealthy enough to move near one, justice requires that we help.	0
We should let these families apply dollars that the state spends on their child to the non-government school of their choice.	0
In that gallery and outside sit the most important guests of the evening.	1
They are children, and parents of children, who are waiting for a spot in a charter or private school.	1
They believe their futures will be brighter if they can make that choice. Look at those faces.	0
Will you be the one to tell the parents “tough luck”?	0
Are you prepared to say to them “We know better than you do”?	0
We won’t tell you where to buy your groceries or where to get your tires rotated, but we will tell you, no matter what you think, your child will attend that school, and only that school.	1
We have the money to send our children where we think best, but if you don’t, well, too bad for you.	0
These children, and their parents, have waited long enough, for a better chance in life.	0
And Indiana has waited long enough for the kind of educational results that a great state must achieve.	0
I have spoken of the economic implications.	1
But, at bottom, this is not about material matters.	0
It is about the civil right, the human right, of every Indiana family to make decisions for its children.	0
It's about the right of all Hoosier children to realize their full potential in life.	0
Will you join me in saying, the waiting is over, change has come, and Indiana intends to lead it?	0
For us sports fans, recent times have brought a frustrating string of “almosts”.	1
At 60, Tom Watson almost won the British Open.	1
The Colts almost won the Super Bowl.	1
Little Butler almost won a national basketball championship.	1
Besides the disappointment of coming so close, the bad thing about “almosts” is knowing that you may never get that close to victory, and history, again.	0
This cannot be the “almost” General Assembly.	0
We are on the 18th hole, in the red zone, on the final possession of a chance for historic greatness.	0
Indiana has waited long enough for local government that fits the realities of the 21st Century.	0
We have waited long enough for an education system known for excellence in teaching, and accountable schools that deliver the results our kids deserve.	0
Our parents have waited long enough for the freedom to decide which school is best for their children.	1
We cannot “almost” end the waiting. One thing is certain.	0
The rest of the world will not wait on us.	0
Other nations, and other states, are forging ahead with the kind of reforms I have proposed here.	0
Indiana is now a leader in business climate, fiscal integrity, transportation, property taxes, and so many other respects.	1
Now comes the chance to lead in ways that, long term, may matter more than all of those Wishing won’t make it so. Waiting won’t make it so.	0
But those of you in this Assembly have a priceless and unprecedented opportunity to make it so.	0
It’s more than a proposal, it’s an assignment.	0
It’s more than an opportunity, it’s a duty. Our children are waiting.	0
Our fellow citizens are waiting. History is waiting.	0
It’s going to be a session to remember.	0
You’re going to do great things. I can’t wait.	0
God bless this Assembly and this great state.	1
I guess you all expect me to say something about now. Thank you so much. Please do have a seat.	0
I'm grateful for the opportunity to be here with you tonight.	1
I want to start, as is often the case, by thanking those of you that are gathered in this room, for starters.	0
It hasn't been easy today weather- wise for a number of you to make your way here, and yet you've done it, so thank you for doing that.	1
Thank you for making your way here. moment.	0
I want to thank those of you that are watching this as well, on some form of video stream.	1
Thank you for taking the time to check in with us here in Kentucky and find out what's happening as we talk about not only the state of commonwealth, but the state of the budget, and they are one and the same, inextricably intertwined in a time like this.	1
I want to thank a couple of groups in particular.	0
You always run the risk when you start thanking groups, but when we come through the weather we have had in recent days, I'm mindful of a couple of groups who I truly think are worthy of our thanks throughout the commonwealth and frankly in the first group throughout the country.	0
I want to send a special gratitude to the men and women who mine the coal that produces the electricity and the heat that keeps so much of America warm at times look this. Truly grateful to you.	1
And while there are fewer of you working now than there have been in years past, your job is no less critical, no less important, and certainly at times like this, no less necessary than it is or has ever been.	1
I want to thank the men and women also who have been plowing the roads that have made it possible for us to get here.	1
From every corner of the commonwealth.	0
I stopped into I stopped into One of our state garages last night and it was fairly slim there.	1
A couple people there sort of managing schedules, but the vast majority of folks were out on the road.	1
I'm grateful to you for the job that you've been doing.	0
I want to thank a group that so often we don't tend to think of except from time to time, even though in reality they're the ones who make everything work, and that is all the state employees. Every single one of them.	0
The tens of thousands of you who come to work every day on so many fronts to do so many things to make the commonwealth work.	0
I want to thank you very much for all that you do and for the 2,000 of you, for the more than 2,000 of you who responded to the email that went out asking for your input, asking for your thoughts on things that we've been doing well but things that we could do better.	1
And while I often in the past have read some of the those notes I'm not going to do that this time but I am going read a few names.	1
These are just some of the 2,000 names who wrote thoughtful, informative, thought-provoking responses to us.	1
People like Michelle Shipley, Chris Tatro, Sandy Whisman, Anna Kelley, Scott Boroughs, John Watkins, Jerry Willis, Stuart West, Jeff White, Kristen Alexander Wilcher, Leslie Bates, Christina Mason, Elizabeth Vasati, Thelma Blair, Damon Preston.	1
Yours are some of those I thought about weaving into this conversation.	0
I'm not going to but in the days and weeks ahead I am going to take some of those emails and respond to them probably one-on-one directly in the form of a video response to the questions that you raise.	1
I want to thank each and every one of, you again more than 2,000 who took the time to weigh in.	1
I want to thank the cabinet secretaries.	1
It is nearly unprecedented that you would have a cabinet that two plus years in is in its entirety the same group that is still here.	1
I don't know where they're all sitting. There they are up here.	1
I want to thank you for the work that you have done.	0
How about a round of applause for our cabinet secretaries?	0
The fact that they still all sit together and like each other, spend time together inside and outside of work, truthful grateful to each and with every one of you for what you do to lead the commonwealth forward.	1
I want to thank our lieutenant governor who has been my right arm through the last two years and change and a year before that.	1
I thank you for the job you do to represent Kentucky so well day in and day out in so many organizations and throughout our schools, et cetera.	0
Thank you to our lieutenant governor. Appreciate it. Thank you.	0
I want to thank the person for whom it would be possible for me to do this, I want to thank my wife and our children who have put up with tremendous sacrifice in order to allow me the opportunity to serve alongside those of you in this legislature.	0
So thank you to my wife, the First Lady.	1
I want to thank another group that often perhaps doesn't get thanked enough.	0
We get excited about new companies coming, as well we should.	1
We get excited about new jobs being created, as well we should.	0
But there are any number of other companies that have already been here some for many years, and I want to put up on the screen and, Gary, I don't know where you went but I'm going to ask you to do it because I didn't really learn how to use the clicker.	1
That is a group of about 68 companies that employ at least a thousand people in Kentucky already.	1
And I want to thank these companies who employ so many of our fellow citizens.	0
It doesn't even include some companies like GM that employ hundreds down at the Bowling Green Corvette plant and hundreds more in various dealerships.	1
It doesn't include companies like a Papa John's that has 500 some people at its headquarters and hundreds more around the state.	1
This is just that have these many people located in one or two facilities.	0
It doesn't include those with retail franchises.	1
So there's even other companies perhaps that aren't on this list but it is many, many dozens who employ so many of our fellow Kentuckians and I'm grateful to you.	0
I want to say three things before we start, and I'm going to touch tonight on just looking briefly back at 2017.	1
I want to look back briefly on 2017.	0
But I really want to look forward to 2018.	0
And the three things that I want to say before we look either back or forward is this: first of all, I love Kentucky.	0
I genuinely, passionately, sincerely love Kentucky.	0
And I know that that is not an emotion that I alone share.	0
And I'm grateful for the fact that so many in this room and so many watching feel the same way.	0
And so much of what we have done and what we are doing and what we intend to do going forward is driven by that fact.	0
I want to say secondly, especially to those of you in this room, those of you legislators in particular but then also to the people of Kentucky, I want you to know that I pray for you. I pray earnestly for you. I pray individually for you. I pray for you as a group.	0
I pray for the people of Kentucky.	0
I pray for the commonwealth that we will be blessed, that we will be preserved from so much that has potential to harm us.	0
I'm a person who believes in the power of prayer, and I want each and every one of you to know that I pray for you.	0
I also want you to know thirdly that I'm I excited for the future of Kentucky. I'm really excited.	0
"One of the greatest compliments I got was recently speaking to a reporter who said to me, ""You always seem enthusiastic about things. """	1
I'm enthusiastic because I believe in the upside possibility here.	0
The future of Kentucky is bright indeed. I love Kentucky.	0
I pray for you and I'm excited about the future of the commonwealth.	0
I want you to bear those things In mind as we take a brief look backward at 2017.	0
The reason I'm excited, the reason that I truly believe in the future is because I believe In the American dream.	0
The American dream is a real thing. It truly is. I've lived it. I've experienced it. So, too, have many of you.	0
So, too, have many of you who are watching.	0
And I want that opportunity for the children yet to come in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.	0
The American dream doesn't come in a box.	0
It doesn't come in some form of a government program.	0
It comes as the result of opportunities that people like us make.	0
That people like us influence the outcome of what people's futures look like.	0
If we look back at 2017, we've had a couple of challenges.	1
We've been left with a whole lot of things that we need to clean up.	0
Literally and figuratively, some physical things to clean up. Others more figurative. Things of a policy nature. Things of a financial nature.	0
One of the things we've talked about in the briefs that we have shared with some of you is that the real budget focus this year is getting our financial house in order.	1
And this is something that we have talked about for quite some time.	0
But looking back at 2017, I want to show you something here.	0
This is a slide, those in blue are the top 50 job announcements in 2017 in the counties that they are going to.	1
And some of them, of course, will pull from people in other surrounding counties, but that's where the jobs themselves will be located.	1
The ones in orange in the top 100.	1
The ones that appear to be kind of gray because they're striped are counties that have companies both in the top 50 and the top 100.	1
I share this with you because I want you to understand that when people talk about economic development, they talk about jobs, everybody wants them in their neighborhood and so even when there's an announcement made, people say, well, it's only happening here but not there. This was just this past year.	0
It covers a pretty amazing amount of Kentucky.	0
It literally covers the northernmost, southernmost, easternmost and westernmost counties of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.	1
The job opportunities are coming, but these are seeds we're just putting into the ground.	0
We're putting these seeds into the ground now, but they will bear fruit for many, many years to come, and I wanted to put that up there for you as a reminder of that which we have, in fact, done.	0
I want to show you this next slide as well.	0
This is a before and after of our own state capitol, the very building that we sit in right now. Take a look at the difference.	1
So many of us have seen this building, worked in this building, spent time in and around this building over the last years, in some case decades.	0
Do you realize this building had never been cleaned since it Was built? Ever?	1
We're going to clean up Kentucky.	0
We're going to do it in any number of different ways.	0
But this is the embodiment of what we're talking about.	0
The only part that is yet to be cleaned is the dome, and you can see it still has a lot of the same discoloration that the entire building used to have.	1
When we talk about the future of Kentucky, the potential of Kentucky, I want to recognize the fact that we have it in our power to make this possible by picking up trash after ourselves, by opening doors for one another, literally and figuratively, by looking out for our neighbors, by taking care of one another, by beautifying the Bluegrass and taking care of our own communities.	0
By looking for things that need to be cleaned, should be cleaned, have not been cleaned, and then cleaning them, we change the perspective have how we view ourselves, how others view us.	0
It changes our whole mindset, our whole attitudes.	0
Gives people hope and encouragement.	0
This is what we're trying to do.	0
The policies that you have put into place, you in the legislature, those of you who have passed legislation last year, the policies you put into place have led to the kind of record breaking investments that we've had.	1
Previously, the best year we ever had in Kentucky: $5.1 billion of capital invested in our state in a single year. This past year: $9.2 billion.	1
Directly the result of policies that you put into place last year. Things like right-to-work.	1
Things like repealing prevailing wage, things like all the other things we've done to make it clear that we're getting our house in order.	1
These are the types of things that have attracted people to our state.	0
17,000 plus jobs were created last year. The most since 2000.	1
Things are changing but these again are seeds that are just now going into the ground.	0
I want to take a look at this next slide real quick. I want to speak briefly.	0
This is how many of you are in elected office in these two chambers.	0
I want to speak to each of you but I also want to speak to those of you that are watching before we start talking about 2018.	0
What happens in 2018 is going to be driven by 138 men and women. 138 out of 4.5 million people.	1
That's 3/100,000 of the population of Kentucky will make the laws, will make the rules, will spend the money, will make the decisions that affect every single bit of every single life in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Three out every 100,000.	1
I want to speak to those of you who have this responsibility yourselves.	0
But I know for a fact some of you are not going to be running again. Some of you are retiring.	1
Some of you are going to be pursuing other things.	0
That's going to leave open opportunities.	0
And I want to speak directly to those of you who are not this chamber.	0
Those of you, perhaps you're in this chamber but perhaps you're somewhere at home and you've thought about serving at some point in time.	0
I want to encourage you to step up and throw your hat in the ring.	0
The greatness of Kentucky and the greatness of the political process in America as a whole is if fact that men and women who understand how wealth is created, who have created payroll, who understand how to budget, who understand how to spend their own money easily and thoughtfully than they would want to spend others' money.	0
Those are the men and women that we need to run. 138 is all we need.	1
So many are already here and so many will be back, and I'm Grateful for that fact.	0
But for those that are not going to be coming back, for those where there's an improvement to be made, I would truly ask if you're out there to think about throwing your hat in the ring, because those that come here every day to serve the commonwealth, led by these men behind me, our Speaker David Osborne and our President of the Senate, Robert Stivers, they need 136 other people with them, and I want to challenge you please to throw your hat in the ring.	1
And for those of you who are not even sure if you're going to do it again, thank you for serving.	0
Thank you for your willingness to be public servants.	0
It is at times a thankless task, but we need that 3/100,000th to do the job.	0
I want to read you a quote that was written.	1
We're in an interesting time right now where the weather causes us to kind of hunker down inside, and on a similarly cold December night in 1776 there was a man not even 40 years old who hunkered down inside a house, took a pen out, sat at the paper and wrote these words, the first line of which you all know.	1
The next lines of which you may not.	0
"Not even 40 years old, this man, Thomas Paine, wrote: ""These are the times that try men's souls."	1
The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the services of their country, but he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.	0
These, too, are the times that try our souls here in the commonwealth.	0
We may not be at war as our nation was when those words were written.	0
But the battles, the divisiveness, they continue.	0
We find ourselves under assault.	0
We find ourselves divided on issues of morality, on issues of spirituality, on issues of politics, on issues of ideology, on economic issues.	0
These too are the times that try men's souls.	0
And again, it is the 138 that will be here through this session and the 138 that will follow them into the next session and into the next generation and into the next century that will always be 138 Kentuckians that whenever the times are tight and trying will step up and stand in the gap.	1
I want to take a look at what we're talking about in 2014. or 2018, I'm sorry, as we look forward, so long we have had issues that have been ignored, and I want to put a graphic up here that will be perhaps a little bit of an amusement to some but speaks to the truth of about we're about to discuss.	0
This is the truth about our challenges.	0
We have in the commonwealth lined up for many, many years, some intentionally, some not, realizing that's this were in this line being told a whole lot of comforting lies, especially about financial issues.	0
When in reality nobody wants the unpleasant truths.	0
The unpleasant truths are a-plenty. And they need to be discussed.	0
And I want to briefly take you through some of the things that we need to talk about as we look forward.	0
One of the things I want to make clear is this, and you can leave that up on the screen.	0
One thing I want to make clear to you is that we are going to fund our pension system.	1
100 percent of the obligation that is owed.	1
That is going to happen in this budget that I will be presenting that's going to be released publicly after this.	1
I'll come back to that in a moment.	1
We're going to fend fund our pension.	1
We're going to fix our foster care and adoption system.	1
We have 8,500 children in foster care, 2,400 plus eligible to be adopted right now.	1
Those numbers are only growing. We are going to fix that.	1
You're going to see those efforts reflected in this budget.	1
We're going to fight this opioid crisis.	1
There's only five more, so I'll pace you guys.	0
We're going to fight this opioid crisis. There are seven of them.	1
There are seven things I want to make sure you understand, among the others that will be reflected in this budget.	1
This opioid crisis is exploding.	1
It's not getting better, and we're going to spend the money, the resources and the attention necessary to address this problem in Kentucky like it's never been addressed before.	0
We're going to invest in education and workforce development like we never have before.	0
We're going to continue to invest as we have done in the last two years, the first two years of this administration, by investing more money per pupil in SEEK than has ever been invested in the history of Kentucky.	1
That number is not going to be changed.	1
The amount that's being spent in the classroom is still there in the budget.	1
We'll come to specifically where there will be change as we move forward.	0
But education in the classroom, education with workforce development, these areas are going to continue to be a priority as we move forward.	0
We're going to reform entitlements in this state.	1
Kentucky is going to lead on this front. You have seen this of late.	0
We did us have our 11-15 waiver approved and Medicaid for able-bodied working aged men and women without dependents is going to change.	1
The expectation and the opportunity and the incentive for people to do for themselves is going to change.	0
We are going to see the impact of that as we move forward.	0
That's going to be implemented starting in July.	1
And the opportunity to connect people to the dignity and the opportunity associated with doing for themselves is going to start happening, and I want to thank those who have worked tirelessly to get us ready, and for Kentucky to be chosen as the first in the nation for this, to be a model for the rest of America is a high compliment to the tremendous works that has gone into making that possible.	1
One of the primary roles of government is public safety and we are going to remember roles of government.	1
We're going to opt to keep the KLEF funding at $4,000, the highest it's ever been.	1
We're going to continue to invest in our law enforcement.	1
We're going to buy new automobiles so that these law enforcement officers, our state police, are not driving around in cars with 200,000 miles on them.	1
You see so many of the accidents and problems that we have had come from that.	1
We're going to get them modern weapons so that they're able to protect us.	1
That is one of the roles of government, and we are going to invest in our law enforcement officers in 2018.	1
We're also going to at the same time, as part of that, focus on our prisons and prison reform.	1
I want to make one commitment to you.	0
Certainly no budget that I'm ever going to be putting my stamp of approval on, we're not going to invest another dollar in building another prison here in Kentucky.	1
We're not spending any more money building prisons to warehouse people.	1
We are going cut down on the recidivism, we're going to find ways to pour into people who have screwed up, who are in prison so that we rehabilitate and re-assimilate them and don't have them recidivate back into the system over and over again.	0
We can do this as part of the way in which we focus on protecting and serving our people.	0
The final thing I'll say is this: tax reform is coming. It is coming.	1
Whether it comes as a part of this session time will tell.	0
It depends on the band width and the appetite and the opportunity that beholds us.	0
But we will in 2018 address tax reform, and it's not simply going to be, and it's not simply going to be, as some would have it to be just raising taxes.	1
"It's not a simple function of raising a tax here and raising a tax there ""and that's tax reform."	0
It needs to be comprehensive, it needs to focus on making us competitive.	0
It needs to be focused to make sure we compete with states around us all over this country as well as those that border us, to make businesses want to come here.	0
These are the things that we're going to be focused on in 2018.	0
As I said a moment ago, the focus of this budget is to get our financial house in order.	1
I want to speak to a few of the specifics of that.	0
A few of the specifics that I want to speak to are things that relate to things that we're calling for, and I'm just going to read a few of these.	0
I talked about funding the pension like we've never funded it before.	0
In this budget that's being presented for you all to consider, there is for state employees, there are currently over $1 billion being funded in the biennium that's going to be put into our state retirement system, our KRS. $1.1 billion.	1
This is fully funding not only the ARC as it has been called.	1
But fully funding what has been owed.	1
By fully funding it we now have an understanding of how much is truly owed, our obligation.	0
I want to make it clear to some of those in this room, certainly those watching don't necessarily understand. You hear we're 13% funded. What does that mean?	1
What 13% funded means, is that if you're a state worker in the krs non- hazardous plan which is 13% funded, which it is, and you're expecting to retire some point, if there's 100 of you, 13 of you will get what you think you're going to get. ,87 of you won't. That's what 13%-funded means.	1
87 out of 100 will not get the retirement they think they're going to get.	1
And for those of you in other plans, maybe the KTRS plan, teachers, that after a strong year in the markets last year, people are appropriately feeling good and happy that we're more funded than we were and yet we're still only 56% funded. What does that mean?	1
That means that 56 out of every 100 teachers that retire will get what they think they're going to get and 44 of you won't.	1
It's not as simple as that, of course.	0
It could also mean that everybody gets 44% less than you think you're going to get.	0
But the bottom line is, the money's not there.	0
So whether it's the KTRS, whether it's the KRS plan, we are going to be funding these like we never have.	0
Never in the history of Kentucky, the whole idea of an arc was put into place back in 2006, '07, '08 because 12, 15, 20 years ago we were fully funded.	1
15 years ago we were still fully funded for most of the plans.	1
Starting about 15 years ago, that began to change, and so about 12 years ago there was the realization that something needed to be done, and so this Arc was this actuarially required contribution was put in place, and it was then suggested to the legislature that certain amounts be contributed.	1
Never once since then, never once in the history of Kentucky has the arc been fully funded for all of our pension systems, not one time, which is why we now find ourselves in the situation where they are all so severely underfunded.	1
This year they will be funded in their entirety for the first time in the history of the commonwealth of Kentucky.	1
[ applause ] For the teachers' retirement plan, that means nearly $2.3 billion in the biennium is being put into the ktrs pension system, $2.3 billion.	1
14-1/2% of the general requirement goes to of the general fund goes to retirement.	1
And it's very difficult, though, at a time like this when you're putting this kind of money into the retirement system to be able to protect all of education, so let's talk about what this looks like as we move forward.	0
We are going to continue in this budget to fund seek classroom dollars at $3,981 per pupil.	1
It's the same as it was the year before.	1
It's the highest it has ever been in the history of Kentucky.	1
Never have we put so much into that.	0
it would be fantastic if we could put still more, but the reality is we don't have enough money to meet the obligations that this state has.	1
So the $3,981 is not going to be touched because frankly we've got to take care of making sure that we don't rob our students.	1
So where then is the money going to come from?	0
It's going to come by cutting administrative overhead that's where it's going to come from.	1
And we can go into specifics, some of which you'll see in the budget.	1
I'm not going to go into that now.	1
Want to encourage to you look at our two largest school systems, in Jefferson County and Fayette County.	1
In Jefferson County alone there have been articles, you have seen, more than 600 administrators making $100,000 a year or more. That's more than $60 million. Conservatively.	1
And a lot more than that if you factor in the true numbers.	1
600 people making $100,000 a year or more who don't touch your students, who don't teach in the classrooms, that's administrative overhead.	1
That's where the cuts are going to come from.	1
We're challenging I'm telling you we need to clean that up in a big way.	0
[ applause ] In Fayette county, Fayette county, well over 120 that are in a similar category.	0
The bottom line is we have far too many people that are not teaching our students that are sucking up the dollars that are intended, that you all budget for our students. That is going to change.	1
We're going to expect the local school districts to contribute local school districts to contribute to transportation.	1
More than they have in the past.	1
It still needs to be done but they're not going to be funded to the same degree by the state as they have historically and we're going to ask them to get their overall administrative costs down significantly, the specifics of which are spelled out and you'll see in this budget.	1
But i want to make something clear because there are certain districts, and some of you know who you are, where you're already cut pretty thin, and yet In Kentucky there are nearly $1 billion currently being held in cash reserves by our school systems, nearly $1 billion.	1
I'll bet that's news to many of you legislators.	0
I know it is to many out there in the general public.	0
It's over $950 million that are currently being just held in the reserve fund.	1
We're going to ask these school districts to tap those reserves.	1
This is exactly what it was intended for, for times like these that try men's souls.	0
This is how we are going to get through this budget crisis.	0
This is how we are going to fund the obligations that we have.	0
We are going to continue to dedicate 100%, 100% of all of our lottery money to education.	1
100% of the proceeds are going to go to scholarships, just as they have, to ensuring that young people have educational opportunities.	1
While it would be tempting and easy to think we should sweep that money to offset things, the people agreed to that lottery under the assumption that those monies were going to that purpose, and that's exactly what we're going to do, and we owe them the obligation of keeping that promise to them and to the young people and not so young people that will benefit from that.	0
[ applause ] We're going to go ahead and put another $100 million in there for another workforce bond pool, and i'll tell you why we are.	1
Two years ago we did this for the first time.	1
And in the course of doing that, we weren't sure whether we would even have enough in terms of applications. We did.	1
$540 million worth of applications for that $100 million potential investment from the people of Kentucky.	1
We got to choose the best 18% of those. But guess what?	1
We didn't fund anything that was requested at 100%.	1
In fact, on average we requested them less than 50%.	1
We funded them less than 50% of what was requested.	1
The net result was the state of Kentucky invested $100 million, and those local jurisdictions and local businesses invested another $150 million.	1
Allowing the investment $100 million that you supported last time we had a budget to turn into $250 million worth of investment the in Workforce Development.	1
That's the kind of investment, we're looking for when we spend the taxpayers' money.	0
So many of the emails that we received came from people that are involved in our criminal justice, in our criminal defense, in our prosecution.	1
We have received a lot of thought, some of those names that I read, you'll recognize. You know what you wrote to us. That was heard.	1
We have caseloads that are insufferable. We are losing good people.	0
People that we can't afford to lose and don't want to lose.	0
People who don't want to leave their jobs because it's coming at a toll on them and their families and their health in ways that's not fair to expect of anybody.	0
So you're going see us investing money like we never have any time in the history of Kentucky in not only people on the prosecutor's side but people on the public defense side, and you're going see money in this budget to hire 75 new prosecutors and 51 new public advocates in this budget that's going to be presented to you.	1
[ applause ] This investment will make a profound difference in terms of the backlog of cases that we have.	1
This will allow people the opportunity to get out from underneath that.	0
This is money that will be well spent.	0
We're going to leave the cleft money alone, as I suspected we're going to continue to — as I said.	1
We are going to continue to use those monies to provide a $4,000 stipend to our top certified law enforcement officers.	1
The details of that you will see if there.	0
Also as I said we're going to take care of funding things like cars and weapons and other things that are needed by our law enforcement officers.	1
Medicaid I talked about already as it relates to the 11-15 waiver and the changes that'll be coming.	1
In this budget you are going see an additional $34 million being applied to the battle against the opioid drug crisis. That's a significant sum.	1
We have put significant money in before and it sadly isn't even enough.	0
But $34 million will go a long way.	1
Many of the specifics of where and how that is being applied you will see in the details of this budget.	1
But 34 additional million dollars we're going to additionally put in millions more focusing on pregnant women that are addicted to drugs because the cost on the children that are born to an addicted woman and the cost on society financially, emotionally, sociologically, communally is too high.	1
Far higher than any a money we're going to spend on this.	0
[ applause ] Another area where people are just plain overworked, absolutely swamped, you walk into any DCBS office in Kentucky and you will hear the same story, I don't care which part of the state you're in.	1
You will meet some of the strongest, most passionate, most well-intentioned, hard-working thoughtful people you've ever imagined but they're broken down.	0
It's destroying them to be suffocated by a caseload that continues to grow.	1
So we're going to invest tens of millions of dollars into DCBS and into hiring new people and increasing pay, the likes of which has never been seen.	1
Let me give you some specifics.	0
[ applause ] The first thing I want to say is this.	0
Not everybody who works in the state government are the kind of people we need for the long term. That's a fact sadly. Most are. The vast majority are.	0
What we want to do is make sure the people that are there, when this takes effect on July 1st, 2018 and beyond, that the people who are there are the right people, the supervisors are the right people, the workers are the right people, that they are here for the right reasons.	0
We will do that over the course of the next six months, make sure we have the right people in the right seats on the bus.	1
And then what you will see from people who are caseworkers to people who are supervisors, you will see pay increases that range from 10 to 20 percent.	1
We're not 1 and 2 per-centing people. 10 to 20 per cent.	1
Significant pay raises to make sure with the right people we're able to keep them in place and cut down on this turnover that costs us far more money than we save by not investing in this.	1
So we're going to see changes in people's compensation.	1
We're also going to have funding in there to be able to hire significant new people.	1
We already have positions that are unfilled right now that are open that have been budgeted for previously.	1
We're going to focus now with increased pay on attracting those people and making sure that we have more caseworkers and that they're more properly compensated.	1
That will change in 2019-20 and beyond.	0
[ applause ] You're going to see a program $10.8 million for a new program specifically targeting adoption and foster care.	1
Nearly $11 million specifically for that purpose.	1
You think about what is the role of government. It's to protect.	0
It's to take care of those who are vulnerable, for those who truly need our help.	0
It should not be as bureaucratic and insufferable as it is.	0
I want to show you another slide here that will speak to the heart of what we're talking about.	0
I want you to take a close look at the back of these t-shirts.	0
This is the derringer family from Louisville.	1
The mother and father, 1218 Days.	1
That is how long it took them from the time they tried to adopt a child in Kentucky to the time that that was first possible.	1
I want to show you three other t-shirts. 437, 937 days. 1,043 days. Et cetera.	1
These are the numbers of days it actually took these children to be adopted.	1
I want to ask this family if you guys could come on up here, I want you to meet this family. [ applause ] [Editor's note.	0
At this point, the governor recognized a Jefferson county couple who adopted three children, but had wait more than 1,000 days for one child to clear that process.	1
Ashley Derringer talked about the long process and she asked the legislators to do whatever they can to make the process smoother and quicker for potential foster and adoptive parents.	1
This is the face, this is what government is here for.	0
It is only three, as Ashley has said, but I'll tell you what, it's three fewer.	1
There's any number of people that are out there watching that might be able to take one, two Or three children.	0
We are going to invest in like never.	0
We have said we're going to do it.	1
"We're going to do it and we're going to put $10.8 million toward making sure that we accelerate this because the idea that a couple like this, who Want as desperately as they do to be part of the solution, have to wait between three and four years to even be able to do so is a ""shame on us."	1
And we're going to fix this and we're going to focus on this with the efforts of the first lady and so many others in health and family services and dcbs specifically, and so many outside groups for whom i am grateful and won't even start to mention them all. I'll forget some.	1
But there folks inside and outside of Kentucky that are going hope to us address this make sure that we find homes for the most vulnerable among us, that we take care of everyone in Kentucky.	0
We're also going to be focusing on doubling in this budget it's a small number in absolute dollars but I think it's important many in light of all that's happening both in this state and outside of this state, so much attention to all the things that are happening that should or should not be happening in government.	1
We're going to be doubling the budget for the Executive Branch Ethics Commission.	1
They've been boot strapping it for a long time and we're going to double that money so that they have the ability to do the job that they need to do going forward.	1
A couple other things I want to touch on.	0
One of the ways that we make this happen, obviously to be able to fund the things that we are funding, something has to give.	0
Where does this money come from?	0
If you put billions of dollars, more than 20% of the budget into the pension because that is the cost of making sure that pensions for teachers like Ashley actually get paid if those teachers and others expect to actually get their pensions we need to fund that and if we do where is the money going to come from?	1
There's only a finite amount of it.	1
So in the budget you will see that we have actually eliminated 70 entire programs, the specifics of which you will see.	1
There's others, arguably, that could be and perhaps ultimately should be as well.	0
But you have to take the money from somewhere, and so there are 70 absolute programs for which zero funding is included in this budget, and they're scattered throughout state government.	1
We've been thoughtful about it, not indiscriminate.	0
But had we not done so, then the next number I'm about to give you would be the number that so many of you have been expecting and anticipating and that I've heard hypothesized on.	0
I've heard a thousand ideas of the double digit cuts that are going to come, and indeed if we did not do the things that we just talked about, they would be.	0
But the net result of all this that is overall cost in reduction is 6.25%.	1
Everything else in state government other than those areas that I've not mentioned before that are going to be, that are going to be cut, any other areas that we've kept uncut before and the areas that i just talked about with the seek formula for the classrooms and for law enforcement and things of this sort, veterans' affairs, et cetera, there are certain things that we are going to do our best to make whole, but for state government across the board, you're going to see a cut in the next biennium of 6.25%.	1
It's a whole lot less than it would have been had we not been as intentional in this budget.	0
And it's less than what some were expecting but that's still a significant cut.	1
That's what it's going to take to balance our budget. We don't have any alternative.	1
The only alternative we have is to generate more revenue, and that's a topic that will ultimately lead to our conversation on taxes.	1
I want to talk about debt though, because another solution I've heard from the past, I'm going to be very blunt here, there are people that are in this room who have many criticisms about the pension bill, they have many criticisms about tax bills that they've heard discussed who've never In their entire lives, and some have been here for decades, never had a solution of their own, not one, they have plenty, they love to go on TV and talk about everything that's wrong with what other people propose.	0
But they have never had a solution.	0
In fact, some of them supported the idea that on the tax front, for example, or the pension front, I should say, that borrowing money to pay off the pension obligation was a good idea.	1
That was floated a couple of years ago. It didn't end up happening.	1
It's like using your MasterCard to pay off your American express. It doesn't make sense. It's a bad idea.	0
For those individuals, I'm asking to you get real, to be real, to step up and make honest decisions about the kind of ways in which we have to balance this budget because we have to do it by law.	1
But we're for the going to borrow inordinate numbers of dollars.	0
Once again, we are keeping the amount of bonding in this budget to a much lower level than it has been historically.	1
The ten-year average is over 6 and a half per cent.	1
The ten-year average has been 6.58% of our budget has been associated with debt services.	1
In this budget it will be 5.63%, the second year in a row that it's below 6%.	1
And yet I will say, I will say this, that also includes a tremendous amount of money to take care of things like the amazing amount of deferred maintenance on our college universities.	1
Our college university campuses have a tremendous amount, $6 billion worth of deferred maintenance, and there is debt service allowed in here for that to start to be taken care of in conjunction with those Universities using their own resources to make it a priority if they choose to do so.	1
So we're taking care of again similar to the picture you saw of cleaning up physical things, we are going to invest in things look our university campuses.	1
We're going to invest this in things like our bridges and the buildings that we operate in, cleaning things and improving things and repairing things.	1
This is an obligation that we have, not only to those in the commonwealth now but for those that will come for years to come.	0
We also have got to put money in our rainy day fund.	1
We are on trend right now, we're going to end our year, this fiscal year, and as you know we've had to cut the budget in order to make it fit inside of this year's actual dollars.	1
We've had to cut the budget in an emergency cut just in recent weeks.	1
We're going to end our year with zero dollars in the bank. Think about that.	0
How many of you would recommend having nothing in reserve?	0
Nothing, no matter what you earn.	0
You have nothing in savings, nothing in a checking account, something for an emergency.	0
What if something happened like we have seen happen in other states in our country in the past six months happened here?	0
We wouldn't have the resources to be able to pay for it.	0
I'm putting in this budget half of the bare minimum we should have.	1
All credit rating agencies and others have said that we should have at least $550 million in our rainy day fund.	1
That's about 5% of our total operating budget.	1
I'm putting in this budget half that amount.	1
It's a fraction of what it needs to be.	0
It won't be looked upon as favorably as it might otherwise be by credit rating agencies but it's better than nothing.	0
And again I want you to bear in mind that we have universities that have hundreds of millions of dollars in cash reserve.	1
We have school districts that have hundreds of millions of dollars in cash reserves.	1
Jefferson county school district has hundreds of millions of dollars in reserves.	1
Why should one school district in our state have hundreds of millions of dollars more for an emergency but never be expected to use those, than the commonwealth of Kentucky itself does and the idea that we have nothing in our reserve is bad why and it's going to be, and I truly challenge those of you in this legislature to make sure we do not shortchange the possibility of something happening in this state and our ability to deal with it.	1
The last thing I'll say is just on the tax front.	0
Modernizing our tax code is something we've got to do.	0
It has to be brought into the 21st century.	0
It just does, to be more competitive with states around us.	0
And that is something that you are going to see proposals coming from me.	1
And I want to hear any and all proposals coming from you.	0
I have put out emails asking every single legislator to weigh in with your ideas.	1
I've heard from very, very few of you.	0
Some of you I've heard from, I appreciate the fact that you've weighed in, but the idea that just simply raising everybody's taxes isn't the solution.	0
But there are so many of you from whom I have heard nothing but complaints, nothing but comments about how your voice isn't being heard, nothing but plenty of negative commentary after 30 something years of being in this body and never having a solution. We deserve better than that.	0
For those of you that that might apply to I would say this.	0
I want to show you one final picture here.	1
And I'm going to actually hold off on that.	0
11m going to come to this in a moment.	0
I want to talk about at the end of the day why this matters.	0
This matters because it's the responsibility of our state to take care of its people, to pay its bills, to educate, and provide infrastructure.	0
It's interesting you often hear of people that want to get a piece of the pie or people saying they get too much of the pie or we need to grow the pie.	0
I find it ironic and I noticed as I was writing about the actual role of government that it's actually an acronym, as I was writing out these three words in that order I noticed that they spell P I E: protection, infrastructure, education. That's the role of government. That's what we're here for.	0
If we provide for the protection of our people, the infrastructure needed to get goods and services to market and for the education of our people, that's the pie.	0
That's what this budget is intended to do.	1
I want to encourage you please to take this seriously. These are serious times.	0
These are the times that try men's souls.	0
I'd love to sit here and give you lots of rah-rah.	0
Nobody likes the idea of having to cut budgets.	0
Nobody likes the idea of having to make these difficult decisions.	0
There is not enough money, and it's easy to throw stones without coming up with solutions.	0
But now is the time where we need people who are experienced, people who are capable of coming up with solutions to do exactly that, to not just give lip services to working across the aisle but to truly work together to find what is best for Kentucky.	0
We owe this to the people of Kentucky.	0
We need to actually balance our budget in a way that takes care of our obligations.	0
So many of the things that we need, the protection, the infrastructure and the education, can barely be paid for even with this budget that we've put forward.	1
Then there's all the things that we want.	0
If we want more of what we want, then we're going to ultimately have to have the resources to pay for it.	0
And that's going to come by continuing to put seeds in the ground, getting a tax structure and resolving our pension crisis and balancing the budget in a way that will attract other businesses, that when you have $9.2 billion worth of investment going into the ground, that the jobs, 17,000 plus and growing, That will come from those investments alone will take root and germinate and the fruit will be borne for generations but it will take an environment in which we continue to fertilize the ground. That's your job.	1
I'll work with you and I look forward to it but I need and want your support and your help in order to do it.	0
Every year I've shared with you as part of my address a book that i would encourage you to read.	1
"The first year I recommended that you read a book called ""Dreamland"" and if you haven't read it i would still recommend it to you. ""Dreamland. It's about the opioid crisis."	1
"Last year I recommended you read a book called ""Hillbilly Elegy."	1
while it's salty and you may not want to have your young children read it, nonetheless, it's a powerful tale of what grips so much of our eastern part of our state in particular but frankly other parts of our state as well.	0
If you have not read that i would encourage that you do.	0
This year i want to encourage to you read a different book and you see it up here the on screen.	1
"This was published a couple years ago by David McCullough. ""The Wright Brothers. you say 'why that book?'"	1
this is a book about people who dream big.	0
This is a book about people who believe in bigger possibilities.	1
"My high school quote yearbook was by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,: ""lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime and in passing leave behind us footsteps on the sands of time."	1
The footsteps that this legislature is going to lay down that our administration is going to lay down in conjunction with you, that we collectively are going to lay down for the people of Kentucky as someone's going to follow in them.	0
I want you to encourage to you read this book.	0
It's a powerful story about People that you've heard about but maybe don't know much about, about the father and the sister who helped to make everything that the two brothers we've heard of, able to do the things that they did. It's an incredible story.	0
It's not long, 300 pages maybe.	1
But I encourage you to read it and to dream big dreams, to think about the possibilities ahead of us here in Kentucky.	0
There is no reason why we cannot truly lead the nation.	0
We're doing it now with Medicaid reform.	1
We're doing it with prison and criminal justice reform.	1
We're doing it on pension reform if we will pass the bill that you have the capacity to pass and that I know the votes exist and i look forward to having that done.	1
So many people are turning to our state when it comes to red tape reduction.	1
I just gave my pin away to the young man that was here.	1
I did warn his mother it was sharp if he took the back off it.	1
But the fact is we're leading the nation on things like that. And on so many things.	0
Why not on economic development?	0
Why not on what it looks like to Have a rich environment for people to create jobs for future generations? This is my challenge to you. Read this book. Dream big dreams.	0
Let Kentucky aim high and disregard the ridicule as these two brothers did.	0
Disregard the seemingly overwhelming odds as these two brothers did.	0
Disregard all the naysayers and all the dollars that seem to be lined up in other pockets working against you. We do have limited resources. So, too, did they.	0
They were so outgunned it wasn't even funny.	0
But the bottom line is this, if you dream big dreams and you pursue them and you don't quit, what is possible is almost inconceivable.	0
I want to thank each and every one of you for your willingness to serve.	0
We do have differences of opinion on any number of things but we need every single person to be at the oars.	0
We need every single one of you to step up and to serve like you never have in this session because we are going to lay down footsteps.	0
They're going to lead one way or they're going to lead the other way.	0
And the great men and women who comprise this legislature are going to be followed and the things that you do are going to be followed by 4.5 million and growing other Kentuckians.	1
So let's lay down deep, bold, straight footprints for others to follow in the years to come. And let's dream big dreams.	0
I thank you for the opportunity to serve you.	0
I thank you for your attention to this.	0
I thank you for your thoughtful consideration of the budget that will be presented to you. It is a realistic budget.	0
It is one that is not wishful thinking. It's one that we must pass.	0
And it will set us on course for to get our house in order so that the future will be bright and so that our excitement that we have will continue to be as real as it is today.	0
Thank you for your time and attention, for your service to the commonwealth.	0
May god bless you and may god bless the commonwealth of Kentucky. [ applause ]	0
